## How to replace your lost or stolen passport

### Stolen or lost passport replacements inside the U.S.

If you are in the U.S. and your passport is lost or stolen, you must use Form DS-11 to apply for a new passport in person.  
[Follow the guidance from the State Department](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/have-passport/lost-stolen.html#replacelost), which is based on how quickly you need your new passport.  
[Check current processing times](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/how-apply/processing-times.html) to find out how long it will take.

### Stolen or lost passport replacements outside the U.S.

If you are outside the U.S., contact your nearest  
[U.S. embassy or consulate](https://www.usembassy.gov/)  
to replace your lost or stolen passport and find out how long the process will take. In some cases, you may be able to get a limited-validity passport if there is not enough time to get a regular passport.
