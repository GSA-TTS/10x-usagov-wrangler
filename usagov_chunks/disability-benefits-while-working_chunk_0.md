**Receiving SSI and SSDI while working**
----------------------------------------

If you receive Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and/or Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), you may be able to work while keeping your benefits. But the benefit amount you receive may be reduced depending on how much money you earn from your job.

As of 2024, you may stop receiving SSDI benefits if you earn over $1,550 a month. But your eligibility to receive SSI while working will depend on which state you live in.
