Reduce telemarketer calls with the National Do Not Call Registry

  [DoNotCall.gov](https://www.donotcall.gov/)
* By phone: Call 1-888-382-1222 or TTY: 1-866-290-4236

The registry will stop calls from most legitimate companies, but it will not stop scammers. And you will still receive calls from charities and companies you have done business with in the past.
