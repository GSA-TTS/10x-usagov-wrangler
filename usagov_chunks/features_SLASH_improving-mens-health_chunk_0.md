Explore this guide to learn about common issues and ways to improve your health.

**Issues impacting men’s health**

* **Heart disease:** [Men are at an increased risk for heart attacks and strokes](https://www.cdc.gov/heart-disease/about/men-and-heart-disease.html), two leading causes of death among men. Nearly 350,000 men die of cardiovascular disease every year.
