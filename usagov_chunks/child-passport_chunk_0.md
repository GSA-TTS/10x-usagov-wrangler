Children under 16
-----------------

All children under 16 must appear in person to apply. A parent (preferably both) must be present and must sign the passport application.

[Follow the step-by-step process for children under 16](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/need-passport/under-16.html)
from the State Department to:

* Get a child passport application form
* Learn what documents to submit that provide proof of U.S. citizenship and your relationship to your child
* Find out what to do if both parents and guardians cannot apply
* Calculate fees

Passports for children ages 16 and under are valid for 5 years.
**You cannot renew your child's passport.**
If your child is under 16 and their passport has expired or will expire soon, you must submit a new application in person.
