The 988 Lifeline and other mental health services
=================================================

Mental health continues to pose a challenge to millions of people. In 2020 alone, the U.S. had one death by suicide about every 11 minutes—and for people aged 10-34 years, suicide is a leading cause of death.

Mental health challenges can affect anyone. People who suffered trauma may face a higher risk. For example, military service members and veterans face higher rates of suicide than the general population. Understand the options you have to face your mental health struggles and get the support you need.

**Call the new 988 Lifeline**
-----------------------------

The “988” Suicide and Crisis Lifeline [officially launched in 2022](https://www.fcc.gov/988-suicide-and-crisis-lifeline), giving anyone with a phone in the United States immediate access to mental health resources.

Like “911,” the new “988” provides an easy-to-remember three-digit number that people can call during an emergency. The number connects you with the 988 Suicide and Crisis Lifeline, formerly known as the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. There, the caller will get immediate help from one of more than 200 crisis centers.

If your situation is life-threatening, get immediate emergency assistance by calling 911, available 24 hours a day. If you or someone you know is suicidal or in emotional distress, [contact the 988 Suicide & Crisis Lifeline immediately](https://988lifeline.org/). Trained crisis workers are available to talk 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.
