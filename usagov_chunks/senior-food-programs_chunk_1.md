Food assistance programs for older adults
CSFP food package eligibility
SNAP benefits for seniors

SFMNP and CSFP are not available in every state. If your state participates in one or both programs, you may be eligible if you are:

* 60 or older
* Have an income at or below 185% of the [federal poverty income guidelines](https://aspe.hhs.gov/topics/poverty-economic-mobility/poverty-guidelines)

[Use these search filters to find and contact your state SFMNP and CSFP programs.](https://www.fns.usda.gov/fns-contacts)

If neither program is on your state's list, you may be eligible to get food stamps through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).
