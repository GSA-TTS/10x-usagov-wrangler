Federal voting rights laws
--------------------------

Federal laws passed over the years help protect Americans' right to vote and make it easier for citizens to exercise that right:

* The Civil Rights Acts created some of the earliest federal protections against discrimination in voting. These protections were first outlined by the [Civil Rights Act of 1870](https://www.fjc.gov/history/timeline/civil-rights-act-1870) and were later amended by the:  
  + [Civil Rights Act of 1957](https://history.house.gov/Historical-Highlights/1951-2000/The-Civil-Rights-Act-of-1957/)  
  + [Civil Rights Act of 1960](https://www.loc.gov/exhibits/civil-rights-act/civil-rights-era.html#obj110)  
  + [Civil Rights Act of 1964](https://www.nps.gov/articles/civil-rights-act.htm)  
* The [Voting Rights Act of 1965](https://www.archives.gov/legislative/features/voting-rights-1965) prohibited voter discrimination based on race, color, or membership in a language minority group. It also required certain places to provide election materials in languages besides English.  
  + The act also placed limits on certain states with a history of voter discrimination. These states had to get federal approval before passing voter restrictions. [A 2013 Supreme Court decision](https://www.justice.gov/crt/about-section-5-voting-rights-act) struck down this rule.  
* The [Voting Accessibility for the Elderly and Handicapped Act of 1984](https://www.ada.gov/resources/disability-rights-guide/#voting-accessibility-for-the-elderly-and-handicapped-act) required polling places to be accessible to people with disabilities.
