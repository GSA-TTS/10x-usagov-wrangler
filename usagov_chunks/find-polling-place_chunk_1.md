Voting location rules

**Cast your vote at your assigned polling place or polling station**
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Your polling place is based on your residential address. Go to your assigned voting location. Your name will not be on the roster at any other location. Polling places are typically schools, community centers, and other public facilities. The site of your polling place may change from one election to the next, so check with your state's election office before Election Day.

**Can you change your voting location?**
----------------------------------------

You cannot change your polling location. Your state or local election office assigns your polling place, which is where you must vote. If you try to vote somewhere other than your assigned location, you may have to cast a provisional ballot, and your vote may not count.
