U.S. Courts of Appeal
=====================

The U.S. Courts of Appeal hear appeals from lower courts of both civil and criminal trials, but do not investigate the facts of a case. Rather, the Appeals Courts investigate whether or not the law has been fairly and correctly applied by the lower courts.
