How to change your name and what government agencies to notify
==============================================================

You might change your name through marriage, divorce, or court. Update your new name with Social Security, the motor vehicle office, and other government agencies.

**How to legally change your name**
-----------------------------------

The process of changing your name through marriage, divorce, or a court order can vary between states.

### **Marriage**

Before you get married, you must apply for a marriage license. After you apply for the license and get married, your new name will be reflected on your marriage certificate.

where you are getting married to learn about applying for a marriage license and how to change your name.

### **Divorce**

When you file for divorce, you can change your name back to the name you used before you got married. In most states, you may do so when you apply for your divorce decree.

### **Court order**

In most cases, you must file a petition with your local court to change your name. To do so, you may need to file paperwork and appear before a judge to complete the process.
