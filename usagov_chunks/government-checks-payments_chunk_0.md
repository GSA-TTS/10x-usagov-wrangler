**Find out why you received a check from the government**
---------------------------------------------------------

Look for the agency or reason for the payment in the memo area below your address or in the “issue type” sections of the check.  
[View this diagram of a sample Treasury check.](https://fiscal.treasury.gov/reference-guidance/gold-book/section-1.html)  
Scroll halfway down the page to see the diagram. You can  
[look up the authorizing agency directly](https://www.usa.gov/agency-index)  
and contact them to find out why they sent the payment.

If you do not know which agency authorized the payment, call the Bureau of the Fiscal Service Call Center at 1-855-868-0151. They can help you determine which government agency you need to contact.

[Use the Treasury Check Verification System](https://tcvs.fiscal.treasury.gov/)  
to confirm that the check you received is legitimate and issued by the government.
