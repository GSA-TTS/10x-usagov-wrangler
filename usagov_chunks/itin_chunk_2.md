**What to do if your ITIN is lost or expired**
----------------------------------------------

If your ITIN is lost, do not apply for a new number. Instead:

* Check copies of your previous tax returns to find the ITIN you entered on the form, or
* Contact the IRS at 1-800-829-1040 to look up your ITIN

If your ITIN has expired, you must renew it either in person, by mail, or by submitting Form W-7 with your tax return.
