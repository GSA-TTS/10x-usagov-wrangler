Estimate Social Security benefits

Knowing how much you may receive from Social Security is important for retirement planning. Social Securityâ€™s benefit calculators give you a preview of your future payments.

How much Social Security you may get when you retire will depend on:

* Your earnings over your lifetime  
* The age at which you will begin receiving benefits  
* Whether you will be eligible to receive a spouse's benefit instead of your own

You can [use Social Security's benefit calculators](https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/calculators/) to:

* Estimate your retirement benefits based on when you would begin receiving them (from age 62 to 70)  
* Calculate what payments you would receive based on your earning history  
* Find out your full retirement age  
* Learn about earning limits if you plan to work while receiving Social Security benefits
