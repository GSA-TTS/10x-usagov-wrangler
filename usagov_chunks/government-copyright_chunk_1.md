Federal government copyright rules
Using government logos legally

### **Endorsement, trademarks, and agency logos**

You cannot use government materials in a way that implies endorsement by a government agency, official, or employee. For example, using a photo in your advertisement of a government official wearing or using your product is not permitted.

You also cannot use federal government trademarks or federal government agency logos without permission. For example, in general, you cannot use an agency logo or trademark on your social media page to suggest endorsement or sponsorship by the agency.

### **Attribution**

In some cases, agencies will have specific language that they request you include with the materials they allow you to use. In other cases, agencies may release copyright-protected materials under a Creative Commons “CC-BY” or similar license, which requires attribution for use.

**State and local government materials**
----------------------------------------

The U.S. government work designation does not apply to works of state and local governments, which may be protected by copyright.
[Contact your state](https://www.usa.gov/state-governments)
or
[local government](https://www.usa.gov/local-governments)
for more information about their copyrighted works.

**Copyright laws differ internationally**
-----------------------------------------

U.S. copyright laws may not protect U.S. government works outside the country. But the work may be protected under the copyright laws of other jurisdictions when used in these jurisdictions. The U.S. government may assert copyright outside of the United States for U.S. government works.
