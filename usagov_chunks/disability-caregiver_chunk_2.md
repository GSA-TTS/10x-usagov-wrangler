**Veterans programs**
---------------------

There are three programs available for veterans:

* The
  [Veteran-Directed Home and Community-Based Services program](https://www.va.gov/GERIATRICS/pages/Veteran-Directed_Care.asp)
  offers veterans a flexible budget. With the help of a counselor, veterans may be able to hire a family member to help with daily living and activities.
* When a family caregiver is in place for a veteran’s home care, the Respite Care program can help with breaks for the caregiver, while still addressing the veteran’s care needs.
  [Learn more about Respite Care](https://www.va.gov/GERIATRICS/pages/Respite_Care.asp)
  to see if your caregiving situation is eligible.
* [Aid and Attendance Benefits program](https://www.va.gov/pension/aid-attendance-housebound/)
  provides monthly payments in addition to a monthly VA pension for qualified veterans and survivors. These benefits help cover the costs of a caregiver, who may be a family member.
  [Find the VA pension management center](https://www.va.gov/pension/pension-management-centers/)
  in your area to see if you qualify.
