**How to get legal help after a disaster**
------------------------------------------

Disaster Legal Services (DLS) provides free legal help to individuals who earn a low income and live in a federally declared disaster area. Legal advice is limited to cases that will not produce a fee. Cases that may generate a fee are turned over to a local lawyer referral service.

DLS may be able to help you with:

* Insurance claims for doctor and hospital bills, loss of property, or loss of life
* New wills, powers of attorney, and other legal documents lost in the disaster
* Home repair contracts and contractors
* Problems with landlords
