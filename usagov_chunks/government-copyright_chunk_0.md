======================================================

Text, images, and logos you see on federal websites may be subject to copyright or other restrictions. Learn the rules before using materials from government websites.

**Restrictions on using U.S. government materials**
---------------------------------------------------

Not everything that appears on a federal government website is a government work (something created by a U.S. government officer or employee as part of their official duties). Content on federal websites may include protected intellectual property used with the right holder's permission. Before using U.S. government materials such as text, trademarks, logos, or images,
[check with the federal agency or program](https://www.usa.gov/agency-index)
that manages the website to make sure the materials are not restricted.

### **Publicity and privacy rights**

On federal websites, other people may have rights to the work itself or how it is used, such as publicity or privacy rights under state law. These rights protect the interests of the person or people who may be the subject of the work.
