**How to return a Social Security payment after someone dies**
--------------------------------------------------------------

The SSA cannot pay benefits for the month of a recipientâ€™s death. That means if the person died in July, the check or direct deposit received in August (which is payment for July) must be returned.

* [Find out how to return a check to the SSA.](https://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/handbook/handbook.01/handbook-0134.html)
* If the payment is by direct deposit, notify the financial institution as soon as possible. Ask them to return the payment for the month the recipient died and any that arrived later.
