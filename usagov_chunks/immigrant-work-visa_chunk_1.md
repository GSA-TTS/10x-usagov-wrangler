**How to sponsor a permanent worker for a U.S. job**
----------------------------------------------------

To hire a foreign worker, you may have to sponsor them so they can get an immigrant work visa.

First, find out if you have to get a labor certification from the Department of Labor (DOL).

* [Learn about the DOL labor certification process](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/foreign-labor/programs/permanent),
  also known as PERM.
* Apply for certification using the
  [Foreign Labor Application Gateway (FLAG)](https://flag.dol.gov/)
  or submitting
  [ETA Form 9089[PDF, 1.1MB]](https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/ETA/oflc/pdfs/Form%20ETA-9089%20-%20August%202021.pdf).

Once you have been certified, file your certification along with
[Form I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Workers](https://www.uscis.gov/i-140)
with USCIS.
