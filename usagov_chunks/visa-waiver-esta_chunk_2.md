Six Month Club passport rule

**Other travel documents you will need to enter the U.S.**
----------------------------------------------------------

Even if you qualify for the VWP, you will need to bring a passport from your country of citizenship to enter the U.S. Generally, a visitor’s passport must not expire less than six months from the date they plan to exit the U.S. But some countries extend the validity of their passports for an additional six months after expiration. They are known as being part of the “Six Month Club.”

Officials at ports of entry no longer issue Form I-94W, but instead issue an electronic Form I-94 which records entry and exit dates into and out of the U.S.
