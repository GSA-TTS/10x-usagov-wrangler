# Constitutional requirements for presidential candidates

Candidates for president of the United States must meet basic requirements. Learn about the criteria to run for president.

The U.S. Constitution states that the president must:

* Be a natural-born citizen of the United States  
* Be at least 35 years old  
* Have been a resident of the United States for 14 years

Anyone who meets these requirements can declare their candidacy for president. Once a candidate raises or spends more than $5,000 for their campaign, they must register with the Federal Election Commission. That includes naming a principal campaign committee to raise and spend campaign funds.
