# Actions you can take to report imposter or identity scams

Imposters pretend to be someone you know or a person in a position of authority. They often come with an urgent request for money and may appear to be a trusted company (mortgage, bank), loved one, or a government agency.

**How to report**
1. Report to the [Federal Trade Commission online](https://reportfraud.ftc.gov/?orgcode=USAGOV).
2. You may phone the FTC instead at 1-877-382-4357.
3. Also, report [any scam that happened online to the FBI](https://www.ic3.gov/Home/Index).
