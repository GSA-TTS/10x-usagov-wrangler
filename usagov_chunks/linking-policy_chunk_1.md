**Links from USA.gov to other websites**
----------------------------------------

### **Links to government websites**

USA.gov links to publicly available websites that are government owned or government sponsored and are on the .gov, .mil, and .fed.us website domains.

USA.gov also links to:

* Quasi-government agencies and websites created by public sector/private sector partnerships
* State and local government sites
* Government-sponsored websites that end in .com, .org, or .net (such as
  [www.usps.com](https://www.usps.com/)
  for the U.S. Postal Service)

### **Links to non-government websites**

USA.gov links to select websites that are not government-owned or government-sponsored. We do this if these websites provide government information in a way that is not available on an official government website. USA.gov provides these non-government websites as a public service only.
