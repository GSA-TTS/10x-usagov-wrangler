International driver’s license for U.S. citizens
==================================================

If you are a U.S. citizen planning to drive while traveling abroad, find out if you need an International Driving Permit (IDP) for the country you are visiting.

**Know what an International Driving Permit (IDP) is and if you need one**
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

An International Driving Permit (IDP), sometimes known as an international driver’s license, allows you to drive legally in countries that require one. It is a document that translates your identifying information into different languages. If the country you are visiting requires an IDP, you will carry it along with your U.S. driver’s license.

When visiting another country as a U.S. citizen:

* Your state driver's license is valid while driving in Canada and Mexico.
* In other countries, you may need to get an IDP for foreign drivers.

Use the Department of State's website to
[search for the country you will be visiting](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages.html)
. On that country’s page, see the "travel and transportation" section. It will explain your destination’s driver’s license rules for visitors.

If you are not a U.S. citizen and are traveling to the United States,
