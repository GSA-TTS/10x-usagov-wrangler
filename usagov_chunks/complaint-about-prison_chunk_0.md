File a complaint about a state or federal prison
================================================

You can file a complaint about a prison, policy, procedure, or abuse of someone in prison. Learn where to direct your complaint and what steps to take.

**Complain about a local, county, or state prison**
---------------------------------------------------

To submit a complaint about a local, county, or state prison:

1. File a formal complaint first directly with the correctional facility. Find it through the website for the
   [state department of corrections](https://www.usa.gov/state-corrections)
   .
2. If the issue remains unsolved, complain to the
   [state department of corrections](https://www.usa.gov/state-corrections)
   .
3. [Contact your governor](https://www.usa.gov/state-governor)
   if the prison and the department of corrections still have not addressed your complaint.

Give the complaint time to progress before going on to the next step. You can also
[seek qualified legal advice](https://www.usa.gov/legal-aid)
if your complaint remains unresolved.
