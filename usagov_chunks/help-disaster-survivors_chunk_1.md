### Donate items

If you want to donate items, give them through a disaster relief organization or the government. They publish lists of needed items. When you make a donation, follow this guidance:

* Only give items when they are requested.
* Only give items that are on the list of requested items.
* Do not send items directly to the affected area.

### Donate blood

Blood donations are always needed, especially after a disaster.

**How to volunteer after a disaster**
-------------------------------------

To volunteer, register with an organization that was recruited to help. Do not go on your own. Wait until the organization tells you if it wants to deploy you to the disaster area.
