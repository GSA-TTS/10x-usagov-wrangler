USAGov's guide to government benefits during any life event
===========================================================

People navigate life, not government. Yet there are many life events that are associated with government benefits.

If you are considering options for a college degree, looking for affordable places to live or grieving the loss of a loved one, explore this guide to better understand the government services and programs that can support you at these different moments of your life.

**Looking to insure your kids?**
--------------------------------

Get coverage through the Childrenâ€™s Healthcare Insurance Program (CHIP). Many families have trouble affording private insurance coverage, but earn too much to qualify for Medicaid in the U.S.
[Access CHIP to get coverage for your children under the age of 19](https://www.medicaid.gov/chip/index.html)
. This program is managed by your state and can cover well-baby and well-child care, dental coverage, behavioral health care, and vaccines.

**Ready to go to college?**
---------------------------

Apply for financial help toward your education. For most students planning to pursue their dreams and attend college or career school, financial aid is essential.
[Understand how to apply for help through the Federal Application For Student Aid (FAFSA)](https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid)
. Fill out the form and the Department of Education will use your data to determine what federal grants, work-study, and loans you're eligible for. Ask your school counselors for other aid you can access, such as state or local scholarships.
