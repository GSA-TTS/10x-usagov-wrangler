# Voter ID requirements

Each state sets its own voter ID rules. And most require voters to bring identification to vote in person. Know the voter ID laws in your state before going to the polls.

-----------------------------------------------

Your state's voter ID laws determine whether you will need to show an ID and, if so, what kind.

Your state may require you to show a photo ID like a driver's license, state ID, or passport. Or they may ask to see another form of identification like your birth certificate, or Social Security card. If you are a registered voter and have a voter registration card, you are not required to bring it with you when you vote. But you can still use it as a form of identification.
