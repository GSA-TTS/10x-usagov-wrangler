Mortgage help and home repair loans after a disaster
====================================================

If you live in a presidentially declared disaster area, you may be eligible for mortgage assistance or financial help to repair or rebuild your home.

**Mortgage payments on your home after a disaster**
---------------------------------------------------

You must continue to pay your mortgage, even if a disaster damages your home. Contact your mortgage servicer if you are unable to pay. Ask your servicer if you qualify for
[mortgage forbearance](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/what-is-mortgage-forbearance-en-289/).

### **Mortgage help for homeowners with FHA loans**

Borrowers with mortgages backed by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) can qualify for additional help.
[Answer this series of questions from the FHA](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/housing/sfh/nsc/qaho0121)
to determine what help you may qualify for.

Once you answer the questions and know your eligibility, contact your mortgage servicer.
