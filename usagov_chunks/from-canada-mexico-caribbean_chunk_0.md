Entering the U.S. from Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean, and Bermuda
=================================================================

Learn what travel documents you need to enter the U.S. from Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean, or Bermuda.

To strengthen U.S. border security, the WHTI sets standards for proving identity and citizenship when crossing U.S. borders. These standards determine what travel documents U.S. and non-U.S. citizens need to enter the U.S. from Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean, and Bermuda. Travelers who enter from Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and other U.S. territories are
**not**
affected by WHTI standards.
