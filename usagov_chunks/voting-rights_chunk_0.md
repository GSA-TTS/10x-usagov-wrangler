Voting rights laws and constitutional amendments
================================================

Federal laws govern voting rights. Learn about the laws and how they protect your rights and make it easier for you to vote.

U.S. election laws date back to Article 1 of the Constitution. This gave states the responsibility of overseeing federal elections. Many constitutional amendments and federal laws protecting voting rights have been passed since then.

Constitutional amendments affecting voting rights
-------------------------------------------------

* The [15th Amendment](https://guides.loc.gov/15th-amendment) gave African American men the right to vote in 1870. But many weren't able to exercise this right. Some states used literacy tests and other barriers to make it harder to vote.  
* The [19th Amendment](https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/featured-documents/amendment-19), ratified in 1920, gave American women the right to vote.  
* The [24th Amendment](https://history.house.gov/HistoricalHighlight/Detail/37045), ratified in 1964, eliminated poll taxes. The tax had been used in some states to keep African Americans from voting in federal elections.  
* The [26th Amendment](https://history.house.gov/HistoricalHighlight/Detail/37022), ratified in 1971, lowered the voting age for all elections to 18.
