USAGov's product principles
===========================

Our product principles are the fundamental values that motivate our actions and decisions. They help us evaluate our work in serving people and government agencies.

USAGov is the front door to a government by the people, of the people, for the people.

We welcome people by:

* Building experiences that work on every screen, on every channel, in English and in Spanish
* Using assistive technologies to create complete, easy-to-navigate experiences for users
* Prioritizing the needs of people who have to rely on interacting directly with the government
