If you are a foreign citizen re-entering the U.S., the documentation you need may depend on your immigration status:

  - You may use advance parole to re-enter the U.S. without applying for a visa. It is commonly used for re-entry by people in the process of applying for permanent residence, applying for a status adjustment, or applying for asylum.
* **Refugee travel document**
  - You may be able to use this document to re-enter the U.S. if you have refugee or asylum status.

You must apply for advance parole or a refugee travel document before you leave the U.S. If you do not, you may not be allowed to return to the U.S. Use
