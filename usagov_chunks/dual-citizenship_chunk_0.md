How to get dual citizenship or nationality
==========================================

Having dual citizenship, also known as dual nationality, means being a citizen of the United States and another country at the same time.

**Learn about the requirements for dual citizenship**
-----------------------------------------------------

Whether you were born an American citizen or became one through naturalization, if you have dual citizenship, you:

* Owe allegiance to both the U.S. and a foreign country
* Must use a U.S. passport to enter and leave the U.S.
* Do not have to choose one nationality over the other. As a U.S. citizen, you may naturalize in another country without risking your U.S. citizenship.
