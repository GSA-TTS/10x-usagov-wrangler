### Home Equity Conversion Mortgages for seniors

Homeowners over age 62 may qualify for a type of home loan known as reverse mortgages. The Home Equity Conversion Mortgage (HECM) program is the only reverse mortgage insured by the government.

The HECM lets you withdraw some of your homeâ€™s equity to use for home maintenance, repairs, or living expenses.
