How to vote absentee or by mail if you live in the U.S.
-------------------------------------------------------

Get your ballot from your state or territory.

Visit
[Can I Vote](https://www.nass.org/can-i-vote/absentee-early-voting)
and choose your state from the dropdown menu. It will take you right to your state's absentee voting or vote-by-mail page.

Your state may require you to have a valid excuse to vote absentee. Acceptable excuses vary by state. Most include:

* Being unable to get to your polling place due to illness, injury, or disability
* Being on business travel or vacation outside of your county or city of residence on Election Day
* Being a student at an out-of-state college or university

#### **Know your state’s absentee and vote-by-mail ballot deadlines**

* Make sure you follow your state’s deadlines for requesting and returning your ballot.
  [See your state’s voting deadlines](https://www.usvotefoundation.org/state-election-dates-and-deadlines)
  . And note whether the deadline is for when your ballot must be postmarked or for when it must be received by the election office.
