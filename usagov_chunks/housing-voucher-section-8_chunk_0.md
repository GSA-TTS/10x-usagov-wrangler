What are Section 8 housing choice vouchers?
-------------------------------------------

The Section 8 housing choice voucher program is provided by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). This program can offer you a voucher to help you afford safe, private housing. Section 8 vouchers are managed by your local public housing agency (PHA).

### How Section 8 housing vouchers work

Families with a low income, seniors, and people with disabilities may qualify to use Section 8 vouchers to find housing.

* You can choose any housing that meets the program requirements, such as a single-family home, townhouse, or apartment.
* Housing choice vouchers can pay for all or part of your rent.
* The PHA pays its part of the rent to the owner (landlord), and you as the tenant pay the difference.
