The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA)
=======================================

The Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) lets eligible employees take unpaid leave for medical or family reasons. Learn about benefits, requirements, and how to report violations.

**FMLA benefits**
-----------------

FMLA allows up to 12 weeks of unpaid leave in a 12-month period for qualifying life events. Your employer must protect your job and access to your group health benefits while you are on leave.

**FMLA eligibility**
--------------------

Not all employees are eligible for FMLA. You must work for a covered organization to take FMLA leave. FMLA covers:

* Private organizations with at least 50 employees
* All government agencies and public and private elementary and secondary schools

Even if your employer is covered by FMLA rules, you are not automatically eligible for FMLA leave. All of these criteria must be met to qualify for FMLA leave:

* You've worked for your employer for at least 12 months.
* You've worked at least 1250 hours for your employer in the last 12 months.
* Your employer has 50 employees within 75 miles of your worksite.

Some states have different eligibility rules for their family leave programs.
