TANF application process
How to apply for TANF

**Find out if you are eligible for TANF benefits and apply**
------------------------------------------------------------

Every state or tribal territory has its own TANF requirements for who can get financial help, services, or other benefits. You must be a resident of the state where you are applying.

[Find your local TANF office](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ofa/map/about/help-families)

**Check your TANF balance**
---------------------------

Every state issues TANF benefits electronically on a debit card or through direct deposit. But some also issue benefits with paper checks.

If you receive your benefits electronically:

* Check the receipt from the store where you made your purchase using a TANF card. Many stores will print the amount of money left on your card.  
* Find out if your state offers a mobile app to help manage your benefits and check your available balance.  
* Look for a phone number on the back of your card. The number may be for your local TANF office, which can tell you your balance.
