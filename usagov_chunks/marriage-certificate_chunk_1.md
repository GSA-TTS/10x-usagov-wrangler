## How to get a copy of a marriage license

Most marriage licenses expire within 30 days to a year, depending on the issuing state. If yours expires or gets lost before you get married, apply for a new one.

[Contact the vital records office in the state](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/w2w/index.htm) where you are getting married to find out how to apply.
