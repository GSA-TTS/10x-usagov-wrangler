Employer FMLA notification requirements

**FMLA forms**
--------------

Some companies and organizations may require employees to verify their reasons for taking leave. The U.S. Department of Labor provides employers with
[FMLA certification forms](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fmla/forms)
that employees can submit to verify health-related issues or military service. However, these certification forms are optional, and employers may choose to create their own.

**Required notification under the FMLA**
----------------------------------------

### Posters

If your establishment is covered, you must post an FMLA poster that all employees and applicants can see.
[Download the Department of Laborâ€™s FMLA poster](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/posters/fmla)
to print or post electronically.

### Notice in employee handbooks

If any employees are eligible for the FMLA, you must include an overview of the FMLA in an employee handbook or as a handout. This document must include the same information as the poster. The notice can be distributed electronically.
