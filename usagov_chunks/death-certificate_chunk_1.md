### When to use a certified copy or a photocopy

You will need to purchase a certified copy of the death certificate for tasks such as:

Death of a U.S. citizen abroad: how to get death records
--------------------------------------------------------

When a U.S. citizen dies in another country, the U.S. embassy or consulate should get a death certificate or notification from the foreign government. It will then issue a
[Consular Report of Death Abroad (CRDA)](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/while-abroad/death-abroad1/consular-report-of-death-of-a-u-s--citizen-abroad.html)
. Use the CRDA in the U.S. as proof of death for closing accounts and handling legal tasks.

You can get up to 20 free certified copies at the time of death.
[Order more copies of the CRDA](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/records-and-authentications/requesting-a-vital-record-as-a-u-s--citizen/copy-CRDA.html)
from the Department of State.
