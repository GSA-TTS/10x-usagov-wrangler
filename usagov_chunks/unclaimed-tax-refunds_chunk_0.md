### **If you never received your tax refund**

If you were expecting a federal tax refund and did not receive it, check the IRS
[Whereâ€™s My Refund](https://www.irs.gov/refunds)
page. You will need to enter your Social Security number, filing status, and the exact whole dollar amount of your refund.

### If your tax refund check was lost or stolen

To replace a lost or stolen tax refund check, you can request a refund trace. The IRS uses refund traces to track lost or stolen checks or verify whether a check was deposited.
