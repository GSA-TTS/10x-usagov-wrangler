**How to apply for Section 8 housing**
--------------------------------------

To apply for a Section 8 housing choice voucher:

* Contact your local public housing agency to apply for a housing choice voucher or check the status of your application.
* If you need help,  
  [contact your local HUD office](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/field_policy_mgt/localoffices).

Waiting lists and long waiting periods for vouchers are common because HUD and local PHAs have limited resources. A PHA may temporarily close its waiting list when it has more families on the list than it can help. Check back with your local PHAâ€™s website to find out when its waiting list will reopen.
