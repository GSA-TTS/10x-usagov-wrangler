### **Long-term care insurance**

Some
[long-term care insurance policies](https://acl.gov/ltc/costs-and-who-pays/what-is-long-term-care-insurance)
allow family members to get paid as caregivers. Contact your insurance agent and ask for a written confirmation of benefits.

### **Paid family leave**

Some states require employers to offer family leave programs and some programs pay you to care for a family member. The eligibility requirements, the amount you will receive to provide care, and how long you can take off work varies by state. To learn more,
[contact your state labor office](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/state/contacts)

### **Local Area Agencies on Aging**

If your state does not offer a paid family leave program, an Area Agency on Aging (AAA) may be able to help with:

* Counseling and care referrals
* Day care programs for older adults
* Meal deliveries
* [Learn more about AAAs and search for resources in your area](https://eldercare.acl.gov/Public/About/Aging_Network/AAA.aspx)
