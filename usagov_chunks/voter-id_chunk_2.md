provisional ballots name mismatch

**Provisional ballots for name or address mismatch**
----------------------------------------------------

Even with the right ID, you may have to cast a provisional ballot. This can happen if the name or address on your ID does not match the name or address on your voter registration. For instance:

* You get married, change your last name, and update your voter registration. But your driver's license, which you present as ID, still has your unmarried name on it.
* You move and for your voter ID, you present a current utility bill. But you forgot to update the address on your voter registration and the two addresses do not match.

Some states require that you notify your local registration office of any name change.

when you move or change your name.
