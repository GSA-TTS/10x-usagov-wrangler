**How to set up a direct deposit for your tax refund**
------------------------------------------------------

The IRS uses direct deposit to electronically issue tax refund payments directly into taxpayersâ€™ financial accounts. In most cases, you will receive your tax refund in less than 21 days after you file your federal tax return.

To get your refund deposited directly into your bank account, select the direct deposit option when prompted by the tax software you are using. Then, enter your account and routing numbers of the bank account you want your refund deposited into.
