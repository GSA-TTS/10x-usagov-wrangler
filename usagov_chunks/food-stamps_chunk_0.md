How to apply for food stamps (SNAP benefits) and check your balance
===================================================================

Known previously as "food stamps," the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) can help you pay for food if you have a low income.

Each month, SNAP benefits are added to an Electronic Benefits Transfer (EBT) card to use when you shop for food.

To be eligible for SNAP benefits, you must meet your stateâ€™s requirements, including income limits. States can also take other resources into account, like the money you have in your bank, to decide if you qualify for SNAP.

To apply for SNAP, contact your state or local SNAP office. Depending on your state, you may be able to submit a food stamp application online, in person, by mail, or by fax. You may need to be interviewed before being approved for SNAP benefits.
