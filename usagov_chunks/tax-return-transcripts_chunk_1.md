Get a copy of your federal tax return
-------------------------------------

Copies of tax returns are exact replicas of your tax return and all the attached forms you submitted. In most cases, you will need a transcript rather than a copy of your tax return. But you may need a copy of your tax return for other reasons, like filing an amended tax return.

* You can get copies of your last 7 years of tax returns.
* Each copy is $30.
* It may take up to 75 days to process your request.
