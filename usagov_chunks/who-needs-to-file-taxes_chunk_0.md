Find out if you need to file a federal tax return
=================================================

An IRS online tool can help you decide whether your filing status and income require you to file a tax return.

You may not have to file a federal income tax return if your income is below a certain amount. Taxable income not only includes earnings from your job but can also include retirement and disability benefits.

Even if your income is below the amount that requires you to file, you can still file a return to claim a refundable tax credit or get a tax refund. To find out if you must file a return:

* Use the IRS
  [online interview tool to find out if you need to file a tax return](https://www.irs.gov/help/ita/do-i-need-to-file-a-tax-return)
  , or
* [Use the IRS filing threshold chart](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/check-if-you-need-to-file-a-tax-return)
  to learn what gross income amounts may require you to file based on your age and filing status.
