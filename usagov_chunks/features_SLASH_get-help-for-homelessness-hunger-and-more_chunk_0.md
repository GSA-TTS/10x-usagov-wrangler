Get help for homelessness, hunger, and more
===========================================

Every day, hundreds of thousands of Americans face homelessness and go without proper food and shelter. It can affect people at any age and from all walks of life. And if you’re experiencing financial issues, domestic violence, or substance abuse, you may be at special risk.

Whether you or a loved one is facing a housing or food crisis, it’s important to know there are potentially life-saving resources near you that can help:

* Find a homeless shelter by dialing 211, or
  [visit 211.org](https://www.211.org/)
  to find services and resources in your community.
* [Get veterans housing assistance](https://www.va.gov/HOMELESS/for_homeless_veterans.asp)
  with help from the Department of Veterans Affairs.
* [If you’re about to become homeless](https://www.usa.gov/emergency-housing)
  , learn what to do right away to stay safe and find alternate housing.
* [Explore food assistance programs](https://www.nutrition.gov/topics/food-security-and-access/food-assistance-programs)
  , including searching for a local food bank or applying for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP, also known as food stamps).
