How to print Form I-94 online
Check travel history from Form I-94

With the CBP One app or I-94 website, you can also:

* See your most recent I-94 form and print it, in case you need your record of legal admission to the U.S. The CBP One app also allows you to have a digital version of your I-94 on your phone.
* Get a travel history from the last 10 years of your arrivals and departures from the U.S.
* Find out how long you are legally allowed to stay in the US
* Read frequently asked questions about the I-94

Customs and Border Protection (CBP) sends visitors email reminders about their remaining time in the U.S. In addition, it sends notifications to travelers who may have exceeded their admission period.

**Departing the U.S. with Form I-94**
-------------------------------------

In most cases, your departure from the U.S. will be recorded electronically, whether you are traveling by air, land, or sea.

### Unusual I-94 departure situations

* If your Form I-94 was issued to you on paper, you must give it to the airline or a CBP officer when you depart the U.S.
* If you received your I-94 electronically when you entered the U.S. by air, land, or sea, but plan to depart by land to Canada or Mexico, your exit may not be recorded properly. This issue may occur if you are not a Canadian or Mexican citizen and you depart by land and re-enter the U.S. after the expiration date stamped in your passport. In this case, you may want to travel with evidence of your land departure, including:
  + Entry stamps in your passport
  + Transportation tickets
  + Other receipts
