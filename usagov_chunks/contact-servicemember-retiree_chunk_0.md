Contact an active duty service member or retiree
================================================

There is no database that you can search to find an active-duty U.S. military member or retiree. But you may be able to contact them through their branch of service.

Confirm that someone is on active duty
--------------------------------------

If you need to verify that someone is on active duty,
[use the Department of Defense's website](https://scra-e.dmdc.osd.mil/scra/#/login?returnUrl=%2Fsingle-record)
to create a service record request.

**Locate someone on active duty or a retiree**
----------------------------------------------

Each branch of the military has policies for contacting service members and retirees. The Army and Coast Guard do not offer a way to locate service members.

To find someone in the other branches, write a letter to that branch. Your request should include the person's:

* Full name
* Social Security number
* Grade or rank
* Last known duty station
* Member or serial number (for Air Force)
* Date of birth (for Air Force)

To receive a reply, include your name and contact information.
