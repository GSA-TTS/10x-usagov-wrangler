How USA.gov manages accessibility
---------------------------------

[Read the accessibility statement from USA.gov's parent agency, the General Services Administration.](https://www.gsa.gov/website-information/accessibility-statement)

USA.gov strives to make our website as accessible and usable as possible. We do this by following Section 508 and the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG 2.1) produced by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C, the web's governing body).

[Section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act (29 U.S.C. 794d)](https://www.access-board.gov/law/ra.html#section-508-federal-electronic-and-information-technology), as amended in 1998, is a federal law that requires government agencies to provide people with disabilities equal access to electronic information and data comparable to those who do not have disabilities.

WCAG is a set of checkpoints and guidelines that help ensure that websites are designed and written properly. For example:

* Images have alternative text so if you can't see the image you can still read the text.
* Color contrast between the foreground and background is sufficiently strong.
* Text resizes according to user preference.
