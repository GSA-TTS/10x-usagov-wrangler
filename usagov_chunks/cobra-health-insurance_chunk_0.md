Learn about COBRA insurance and how to get coverage
===================================================

COBRA, the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, lets qualified workers keep their group health insurance for a limited time after a change in eligibility.

**How does COBRA insurance work?**
----------------------------------

COBRA applies to most private sector businesses with 20 or more employees. It requires an employer's group health insurance plan to continue after qualifying life events. These include:

* Termination or a reduction of a covered employee's hours
* Divorce or legal separation from a covered employee
* Death of a covered employee
* Medicare eligibility for a covered employee
* Loss of a child's or dependent's health insurance coverage under the plan
