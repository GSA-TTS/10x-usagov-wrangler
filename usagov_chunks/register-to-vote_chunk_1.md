Voter registration documents

Abroad and military voters
--------------------------

The Federal Voting Assistance Program lets you
[register to vote and request an absentee ballot](https://www.fvap.gov/fpca-privacy-notice)
if you are a:

* U.S. citizen living outside the U.S.
* Service member stationed abroad
* Spouse or eligible family member of a service member stationed abroad

**What documents do you need to register to vote?**
---------------------------------------------------

In most cases, you will need either a driver’s license or a state ID to register to vote. If you do not have either of these, you may be able to provide other types of documentation, including a bank statement or utility bill. But the required documents you need to register vary by state.
[Check with your state’s election office to find out what documentation they accept.](https://www.usa.gov/state-election-office)
