**Creating the U.S. federal budget**
------------------------------------

The budget planning begins a year before the budget is to go into effect.

1. Federal agencies create budget requests and submit them to the White House Office of Management and Budget (OMB).
2. OMB refers to the agenciesâ€™ requests as it develops the budget proposal for the president.
3. The president submits the budget proposal to Congress early the next year.
4. Proposed funding is divided among 12 subcommittees, which hold hearings. Each is responsible for funding for different government functions such as defense spending or energy and water.
5. The House and Senate create their own budget resolutions, which must be negotiated and merged. Both houses must pass a single version of each funding bill.
6. Congress sends the approved funding bills to the president to sign or veto.
