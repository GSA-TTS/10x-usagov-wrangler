Communicate with lender foreclosure

Communicate with your lender
----------------------------

As soon as you know that you are going to have trouble paying your mortgage:

* Contact your lender immediately and let them know you are having financial difficulties. This gives your lender time to work with you to create a financial plan.
* Do not stop paying your bills.
* Seek help early. Do not wait until you cannot make payments before you act.
