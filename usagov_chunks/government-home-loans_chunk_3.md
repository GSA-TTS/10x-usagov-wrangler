Energy-conscious homebuyers
---------------------------

Energy-efficient mortgages (EEMs) can help you buy a home designed to reduce energy use and have a lower environmental impact.

EEMs can be used to purchase or refinance an existing or new Energy Star-certified home. EEMs can also be used to finance energy-efficient home improvements.
