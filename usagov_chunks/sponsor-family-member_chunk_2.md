**How to apply for permanent residency for a family member**
------------------------------------------------------------

To sponsor your family member,
[submit a United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) Form I-130](https://www.uscis.gov/i-130)
. Each person you sponsor needs a separate Form I-130. You can submit the form online or by mail.

The process for your relative to immigrate to the U.S. requires that both you, as the sponsor, and your relative, as the visa applicant, complete the necessary steps.

The process is different depending on whether your family member is already in the U.S. or abroad.
