**How to sponsor a temporary worker**
-------------------------------------

To hire a temporary (nonimmigrant) worker, you generally have to file a petition with USCIS to allow the employee to come to the U.S.

* [Use this temporary (nonimmigrant) worker classification table](https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/temporary-nonimmigrant-workers)
  to see which classification applies to the job you are offering.
* After determining the classification, refer to the
  [Form I-129, Petition for Nonimmigrant Worker](https://www.uscis.gov/i-129)
  page. It lists the classifications that require employers to submit the form to USCIS.
