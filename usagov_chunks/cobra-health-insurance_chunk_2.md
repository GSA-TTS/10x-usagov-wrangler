**How to get COBRA coverage**
-----------------------------

When a qualifying life event happens, you or your employer will notify the health plan. The plan will send an election notice that you will have 60 days to respond to. If you elect to take COBRA coverage, your employer may pay a portion of or the full amount of your insurance premium.

Contact your employerâ€™s health insurance plan administrator with questions about COBRA, including:

* If you currently have COBRA coverage
* When your COBRA coverage will begin
* How long the coverage may last
