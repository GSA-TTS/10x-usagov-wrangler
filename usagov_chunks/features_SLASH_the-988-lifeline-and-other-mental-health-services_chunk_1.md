**Help yourself and the ones you love**
---------------------------------------

Those who need help for themselves or a loved one should know the government provides many resources in addition to 988.

[**MentalHealth.gov** provides information, programs, and best practices about mental health](https://www.mentalhealth.gov/). Resources include:

* How to find a facility in your area  
* Warning signs for loved ones and family members  
* Tips for talking about mental health  
* What recovery can look like  

**The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA)** also shares valuable resources for those in need. The VA works with retired service members and [supports the specific needs related to their military experience](https://mentalhealth.va.gov/). This includes help for post-traumatic stress disorder and substance abuse.

**The Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)** [helps those battling substance addiction and other health emergencies](https://www.samhsa.gov/). They operate treatment centers around the U.S. and operate a national helpline. Call 1-800-662-HELP (4357) to speak directly with a counselor.

Take the time to speak with those you care about about mental health. No matter what you're going through, connect with loved ones, medical professionals, and community organizations for the help you need. You never need to feel like you have to take on the world alone.
