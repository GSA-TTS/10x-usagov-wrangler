How to contact state labor department

**State labor laws**
--------------------

Each state sets laws related to fair employment and workplace safety. In most cases, state laws offer more protections than the federal ones.

[Contact your state department of labor to learn about the labor laws in your state.](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/state/contacts)
If you live and work in different states, or work remotely in a different state from your employer, check the laws in both states.
