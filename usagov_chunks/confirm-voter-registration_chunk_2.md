How to confirm your voter registration status

How to avoid provisional ballot

**Why you should look up your voter registration information**
--------------------------------------------------------------

States try to keep their voter registration lists as accurate as possible. This means:

* Removing registrations of voters who are no longer residents
* Marking some registrations as inactive

You may be marked inactive if you:

* Do not respond to election officialsâ€™ postcards or letters
  *and*
* Have not voted in the last two federal general elections (a midterm and a presidential election)

If your registration is inactive, you may have to take extra steps before you can vote. If you do not, you may have to cast a provisional ballot.

Checking and updating (as needed) your registration ahead of time ensures:

* Your name, address, and party affiliation are up-to-date. Depending on your state, you may not see your party affiliation listed when you check your registration. This is because some states do not require you to declare a party when you register.
* You have time to make any necessary changes if your registration is marked inactive.
* You can vote.
* You know your correct polling place.
