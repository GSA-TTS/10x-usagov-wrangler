How long does ESTA approval take

When you complete and submit the form and processing fee, you will get an ESTA application number. Use that number to check your
[ESTA application](https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/)
status. It may take up to 72 hours to find out if you are authorized to travel to the U.S. under the VWP.

Each approved ESTA application is generally valid for two years and allows multiple visits to the U.S. within that period without having to apply for another travel approval. If your passport expires in less than two years, you will receive an ESTA approval valid until the passport's expiration date.

When you travel to the U.S. for tourism or business under the VWP, you may stay up to 90 days per visit. For stays in the U.S. over 90 days, you must apply for a visa at a
[U.S. embassy or consulate](https://www.usembassy.gov/)
while you are outside the United States.
