Federal and state agencies have laws about how and when employees can be fired. Follow these policies and your company guidelines to avoid wrongful termination claims.

**At-will employment**
----------------------

All states, except Montana, allow "at-will" employment. This means that an employer or employee can end the employment at any time, for any reason. However, the reason for termination cannot be illegal. This includes:

* Discrimination based on race, sex, age (40 and over), nation of origin, disability, or genetic information
* Retaliation for reporting illegal or unsafe workplace practices
* Refusing to conduct illegal activities
