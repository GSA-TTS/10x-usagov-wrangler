Minor passport validity

Children ages 16-17
-------------------

Children ages 16-17 can apply for passports alone if they have their identification documents. A parent will need to either:

* Provide a signed statement saying they are aware the child is seeking a passport or
* Attend the passport appointment with them

[Follow the step-by-step process from the State Department](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/need-passport/16-17.html)
to:

* Get a child passport application form
* Learn what documents to submit that provide proof of U.S. citizenship and consent from one parent or guardian
* Calculate fees

Passports issued to children ages 16-17 are valid for 10 years.
**Your child cannot renew their passport if it was issued before they turned 16.**
Instead, they would need to submit an application in person for a new passport.
