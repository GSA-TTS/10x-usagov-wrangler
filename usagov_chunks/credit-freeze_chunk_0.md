How to place or lift a security freeze on your credit report
============================================================

A credit freeze restricts access to your credit report. If you suspect your personal information or identity was stolen, placing a credit freeze can help protect you from fraud.

What is a credit freeze?
------------------------

When you place a security freeze, creditors cannot access your credit report. This will keep them from approving any new credit account in your name, whether it is fraudulent or legitimate.

To let lenders and other companies access your credit files again to create new accounts, you will need to lift your credit freeze permanently or temporarily.
