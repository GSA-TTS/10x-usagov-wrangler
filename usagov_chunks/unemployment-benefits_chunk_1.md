**How to apply for unemployment benefits**
------------------------------------------

There is no federal unemployment program. Each state manages its own unemployment insurance program and pays benefits.

[Select your state on this map](https://www.careeronestop.org/LocalHelp/UnemploymentBenefits/unemployment-benefits.aspx)
to learn how to file for unemployment.

In most cases, you should file for unemployment in the state where you worked instead of in the state where you live. If you worked outside the state where you currently live or worked remotely, contact your home stateâ€™s unemployment office to get help with filing a claim in a different state.
