Find out if your child is eligible for CHIP
-------------------------------------------

If your income is too high for Medicaid, your child may still qualify for the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). It covers medical and dental care for uninsured children and teens up to age 19.

CHIP qualifications are different in every state. In most cases, they depend on income.
