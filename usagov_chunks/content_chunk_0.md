**How we manage content**
-------------------------

Our content designers review each section of the site based on a rolling 6-month calendar. We make decisions about content changes based on analytic and search data, customer comments, user testing, and agency updates. The team also makes more frequent updates for timely content changes, broken links, and other urgent needs.
