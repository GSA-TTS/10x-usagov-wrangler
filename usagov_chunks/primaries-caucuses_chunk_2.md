Role of delegates in presidential nominations

**Awarding delegates from the primaries and caucuses**
------------------------------------------------------

The number of delegates awarded to each candidate in a primary or caucus is based on a complex set of rules. These rules vary by state, and are set by the political parties at both a national and state level. In most cases, the people chosen to be delegates are active party members, leaders, or early supporters of one of the candidates. For information about your state's presidential primaries or caucuses, contact your
[state election office](https://www.usa.gov/state-election-office)
or the political party of your choice.

Once delegates are selected, they go on to represent their state at national party conventions.
