# Why your tax refund may be lower than expected

If you owe money to a federal or state agency, the federal government may use part or all of your federal tax refund to repay the debt. This is called a tax refund offset.

If your tax refund is lower than you calculated, it may be due to a tax refund offset for an unpaid debt such as child support.
