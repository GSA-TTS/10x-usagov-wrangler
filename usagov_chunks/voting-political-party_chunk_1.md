General election voting rules
Primary and caucus voting eligibility

**Voting in the general election**
----------------------------------

In the general election, you are eligible to vote for any candidate from any party. It does not matter if you are registered with a political party or who you voted for in the past. And you can vote in the general election even if you did not vote in your state's primary or caucus.

**Voting in primary and caucus elections**
------------------------------------------

Primaries and caucuses are ways that political parties in each state choose a candidate to run for president or Congress. Political parties in states, towns, and cities may also use primaries to choose candidates for statewide or local office. Depending on your state's or locality's voting rules, its primary or caucus elections can be open, closed, or a combination of both. The type of primary or caucus can affect your voting eligibility:

* During an open primary or caucus, people can vote for a candidate of any political party.
* During a closed primary or caucus, only voters registered with that party can take part and vote.
* "Semi-open" and "semi-closed" primaries and caucuses are variations of the two main types.
