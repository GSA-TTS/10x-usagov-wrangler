Electoral College
What if electors donâ€™t vote as pledged?
Can someone win popular vote but lose election?

While the Constitution does not require electors to vote for the candidate chosen by their state's popular vote, some states do. The rare elector who votes for someone else may be fined, disqualified, and replaced by a substitute elector. Or they may even be prosecuted by their state.
