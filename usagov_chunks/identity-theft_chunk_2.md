**How identity theft happens**
------------------------------

There are several ways that scammers can steal your identity, including in person, online, through social media, and by phone. Scammers may:

* Steal your wallet or purse to get ID, credit, or bank cards
* Go through your trash to retrieve bank statements or tax documents
* Install skimmers at ATM machines, cash registers, and fuel pumps to digitally steal information from your bank card
* Get personal information from your phone when you use public Wi-Fi
* Use “phishing” to get information from you through fraudulent email, texts, or phone calls
* Look through your social media accounts to find identifying information in posts or photos. Or they may ask you for personal information in online quizzes and surveys.
