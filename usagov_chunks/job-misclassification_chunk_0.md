Employee vs independent contractor classification

# Job misclassification

Job misclassification happens when a company incorrectly says you are an independent contractor instead of an employee. This affects your pay, benefits, and protection.

**Misclassification of employees**
----------------------------------

Federal labor laws may classify you as an employee rather than an independent contractor based on your interaction with a company. This classification takes into account the amount of instructions you receive about what you can and cannot do at work. It may also depend on whether your relationship with the business is temporary or continuous. You can be an employee even if a company:

* Sends you a 1099 tax form
* Makes you sign a contractor agreement
* Verbally states that you are an independent contractor
* Pays you in cash or off-the-books
* Claims that being a contractor is standard practice
* Requires you to work offsite
