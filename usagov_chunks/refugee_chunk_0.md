To be eligible for refugee status, you must be:

* Outside the United States
* Able to demonstrate that you were persecuted or have a fear of persecution in your home country due to your:
  + Race
  + Religion
  + Nationality
  + Social group
  + Political opinion

In most cases, it can take several months or more to go through all of the steps in the process of seeking refuge. Typically, to apply, you must first register with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in the country to which you have fled. UNHCR will determine if you qualify for refugee status.
