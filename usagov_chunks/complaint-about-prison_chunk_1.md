**Complain about a federal prison**
-----------------------------------

To submit a complaint about a federal prison:

1. File a formal complaint directly with the facility.
   [Look up the prison contact information.](https://www.bop.gov/locations/)
2. If the prison did not resolve your complaint, file a complaint with the
   [Bureau of Prisons (BOP) regional office](https://www.bop.gov/about/facilities/offices.jsp)
   that oversees the facility.
3. If you still cannot get your issue addressed, contact
   [BOP Headquarters](https://www.bop.gov/contact/)
   or the
   [Department of Justice - Office of the Inspector General](https://oig.justice.gov/about/directory)
   , which oversees BOP.
