Student loan delinquency and default consequences

**Student loan delinquency and default**
----------------------------------------

If your student loan payment is one day late, your account is delinquent. If it stays delinquent, it will go into default.

To prevent default, contact your loan servicer right away. Default has serious financial consequences, including:

* Hurting your credit rating and your ability to buy a car or house or get a credit card
* Having your tax refunds withheld and applied toward your defaulted loan
* Having your wages garnished (withheld) to repay your loan
