USAGov accountability standards
How USAGov maintains content accuracy

USAGov is accountable for all of the information that we share with the public.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We ensure accountability by:

* Collaborating across agencies to ensure the accuracy and consistency of content and advice. It is better to be incomplete than incorrect.
* Respecting the cultural differences between speakers of different languages, and never relying solely on literal translation to achieve the intent of a piece of content
* Accounting for the experience of every USAGov staff role that makes our service possible so they can be responsive to the needs of the public

USAGov is a productivity tool, giving people fast, accurate service.
--------------------------------------------------------------------

We respect the people who use our services by:

* Delivering exactly what we say we will in each experience; neither under- nor over-promising
* Optimizing for the most common and important tasks, which change over time based on world events, policy, and circumstances
* Taking time to understand where we can build for a general audience, and where we should offer different paths for different needs
