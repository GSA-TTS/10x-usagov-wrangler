### **Get food assistance through Medicare**

If you have insurance through Medicare Advantage (Part C), you may be eligible for a Medicare flex card. This card is a benefit offered by some insurers and is not issued by the government. It acts as a food allowance card for seniors, and can also help pay for utilities, transportation to medical appointments, and more. Not all Medicare Advantage insurance plans offer flex cards.

And if you currently have Medicare Advantage, contact your insurance provider to find out if they issue Medicare flex cards.
