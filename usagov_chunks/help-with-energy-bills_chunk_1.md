Weatherization Assistance Program eligibility
Contact for utility disconnection assistance

**Find out if you are eligible for WAP and apply**
--------------------------------------------------

For home improvements that save money on energy, you may qualify for help through the Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP).

Your eligibility for weatherization assistance depends on your income. Or you may qualify if you already receive benefits through a federal assistance program such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) or Supplemental Security Income (SSI). To see if you are eligible and how to apply, contact your state's WAP office.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Each state has a different policy about when utility companies can and cannot disconnect your electricity or natural gas for non-payment. These policies may be based on:

* The current weather in your area
* Your age
* If you have a disability
* Which utility provider you have
