**Schedule burial in a national cemetery**
------------------------------------------

The burial scheduling process depends on if the deceased person previously received a pre-need decision letter.

Various U.S. states and government agencies, including the VA, maintain veterans cemeteries where your loved one may be eligible for burial. Arlington National Cemetery and the United States Soldiers' & Airmen's Home National Cemetery are maintained by the Department of the Army.

Keep in mind that the VA cannot guarantee burial in a specific cemetery.

### **Scheduling with a pre-need decision letter**

If there is a pre-need letter, a loved one or funeral director can request the burial. Call the National Cemetery Scheduling Office at 1-800-535-1117.

### **Scheduling without a pre-need decision letter**

[Without a pre-need letter, follow the VAâ€™s three steps to schedule a burial.](https://www.va.gov/burials-memorials/schedule-a-burial/)
