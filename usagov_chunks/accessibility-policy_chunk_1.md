Section 508 compliance requirements

* Headings are correctly used and represent an accurate and logical outline of the content (they're not just ordinary text made to look big and bold).
* Links make sense by themselves (no links that say "click here" or "more...").
* Tables are used for laying out tabular information and have proper headings and summaries.
* Lists items are defined as HTML bulleted lists to present items of equal status or value and as numbered lists if a particular order to the items is appropriate.
* The content is fully accessible and operable with keyboard navigation only.

We aim for A and AA compliance across our site. We also look for opportunities to meet AAA compliance.
