How to get a REAL ID and use it for travel
==========================================

The REAL ID Act is a law that sets higher security standards for state-issued driver's licenses and identification cards (IDs).

**How to get a REAL ID**
------------------------

When you apply for or renew your driver’s license or state identification card, you can choose to make it REAL ID-compliant. When you receive your new card, it will have the REAL ID star marking at the top right.

The process of getting a REAL ID and what documents you must provide depends on your state. In most cases, your state driver’s licensing agency will require you to bring:

* **Proof of identity**
  - To prove your identity, you can bring a U.S. birth certificate, U.S. passport, or Permanent Resident Card (Green Card) if you are a non-U.S. citizen.
* **Proof of a Social Security number**
  - You can provide your Social Security card, Form W-2, which shows your earnings for tax purposes, or a pay stub or paycheck from your job.
* **Proof of residency**
  - Your state department of motor vehicles may ask you for a deed, mortgage statement, lease agreement, utility bill, or bank statement to prove you are a state resident.
