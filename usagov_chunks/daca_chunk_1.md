If you did not obtain DACA by July 16, 2021, you may still file for it and for work authorization. But at this time, the Department of Homeland Security will not be able to grant your initial request for DACA or work authorization.

to learn:

* If you are eligible to request DACA based on:
  + Your age
  + When you came to the U.S.
  + Your education or military status
* How to file for the first time and what documents you need to submit or renew your DACA request online
