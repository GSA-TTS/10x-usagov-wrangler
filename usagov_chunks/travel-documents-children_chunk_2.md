### Providing parental consent when a child travels without both custodial parents

Ports of entry in many countries have security measures to prevent
[international child abduction](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/International-Parental-Child-Abduction.html)
. If your child is traveling alone or with only one parent or legal guardian, they may need a letter of consent from the other custodial parent.

* The letter of consent, preferably in English and notarized, from the other parent (if the child is traveling with one custodial parent) or signed by both parents (if the child is traveling with a guardian or alone) should say: "I acknowledge that my child is traveling outside the country with [the name of the adult] with my permission."

Additionally, if a minor is traveling abroad alone:

* [Contact the embassy or consulate of the country your child will be visiting](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/consularnotification/ConsularNotificationandAccess.html)
  and ask about entry and exit requirements for that country.
* The airline may require you to submit an unaccompanied minor form and pay them a fee for unaccompanied minor service. This service provides an airline employee escort for your child at the airport and on board the plane. In addition, you and the person picking your child up at their destination may also need to provide the airline with identification and contact information.
  + Contact your airline before your childâ€™s trip to find out:
    - What age requirements the airline has for their unaccompanied minor service
    - If you can book a ticket with a connecting flight
    - What documents and fees are required
