Lost all your IDs: how to get a copy of your birth certificate
--------------------------------------------------------------

Check with your
[birth stateâ€™s vital records office](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/w2w/index.htm)
for what it requires. Most states have another way to verify your identification, such as:

* Your sworn statement of identity
* A notarized letter and a copy of the photo ID from the mother or father listed on your birth certificate

If you cannot get a copy of your birth certificate, try to
[replace your driver's license](https://www.usa.gov/state-motor-vehicle-services)
first.
