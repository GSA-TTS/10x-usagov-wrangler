International travel documents for children
===========================================

See what documents a child needs to travel to or from the U.S. alone or with a parent or relative.

Non-U.S. citizen children traveling to the U.S.
-----------------------------------------------

All children, including infants, must have their own travel documents, such as a passport or visa to enter the U.S.

Additionally, if the child is traveling alone, with only one of their custodial parents, or with a guardian to the U.S., they should have:

* Documents that their country requires for children traveling outside their country without both parents
  + Each country has its own rules for the specific documents it requires for a child to be allowed to leave their home country without both of their custodial parents or with a guardian. Contact
    [the embassy or consulate of the country the child is a citizen of](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/consularnotification/ConsularNotificationandAccess.html)
    to find out what specific documents the country requires to allow the child to leave their country.
* A letter of consent, preferably in English and notarized, from the other parent or signed by both custodial parents.
  + The letter should say: "I acknowledge that my child is traveling outside the country with [the name of the adult] with my permission."
  + A parent who frequently crosses the border by land with a minor should always carry a letter of permission from the other parent.
  + A parent with sole custody of the child they are traveling with should carry a copy of the custody document.
