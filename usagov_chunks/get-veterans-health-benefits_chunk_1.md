**Health benefits for military dependents**

There are several health benefit programs that spouses, children, survivors, and family caregivers may qualify for. The most common ones for dependents are:

* The Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs (CHAMPVA)  
* TRICARE  

While CHAMPVA and TRICARE are similar, each program has its own eligibility requirements. In some cases, dependents may be eligible for both programs, but they cannot be used together to cover health care costs.
