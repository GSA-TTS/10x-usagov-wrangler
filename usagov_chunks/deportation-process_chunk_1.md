Voluntary departure in deportation

Immigration court hearings and rulings
--------------------------------------

An immigration court of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) hears the related case.

If a judge rules that the deportation should proceed, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) carries out a removal order.

Before removal is carried out, you might be able to leave the U.S. at your own expense. This is known as voluntary departure.
