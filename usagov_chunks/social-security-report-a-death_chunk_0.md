You must report a beneficiary's death to the Social Security Administration (SSA). Find out how to cancel benefits, return payments, and if you are eligible for survivor benefits.

**How to report a death to Social Security and Medicare**
---------------------------------------------------------

The SSA handles death reports for both Social Security and Medicare recipients. To report a death, you can do one of the following:

* Provide the deceased person's Social Security number to the funeral director so they can report the death to the SSA.
* [Look up and contact your local Social Security office.](https://secure.ssa.gov/ICON/main.jsp)
  Or call the SSA's main number at 1-800-772-1213 (TTY 1-800-325-0778) to make the report.
  + SSA only accepts reports of death by phone or in person. They do not accept reports by email or online.
  + If you report the death to SSA yourself instead of through a funeral director, you may do so without the deceased personâ€™s death certificate to begin the process. But you will need it later to complete the report.
