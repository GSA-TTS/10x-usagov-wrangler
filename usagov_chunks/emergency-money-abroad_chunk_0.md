# How to get money if you are in a foreign country during an emergency

Find out how you can get money wired or obtain a loan in an emergency abroad from the U.S. State Department or a U.S. embassy. And find out how you can pay your loan back.

If you are outside the U.S. and need money in an emergency, there are a number of ways you can have money sent from a friend or family member. These include:

* Bank transfer  
* Credit cards  
* Wire transfer  

If these options are not possible, the U.S. State Department may be able to help your friend or family member transfer the money.
