--------------------------------------

The amount of tax withheld from your pay depends on what you earn each pay period. It also depends on what information you gave your employer on Form W-4 when you started working. This information, like your filing status, can affect the tax rate used to calculate your withholding. Contact your employer to get a copy of the W-4 you submitted and confirm what tax withholdings you requested.

Since the exact amount that is withheld from your pay can change with each paycheck, the easiest way to figure out your tax withholding is by estimating it.
