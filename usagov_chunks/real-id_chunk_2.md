Can I fly without a REAL ID?
Get non-REAL ID license

**Can you still get a non-REAL ID-compliant license or state ID?**
------------------------------------------------------------------

You will still be able to get a driver's license or state ID card that is not REAL ID-compliant. But you will not be able to use it for air travel or to get into federal facilities or military installations.

[Look up and visit your state's driver's licensing agency website](https://www.usa.gov/state-motor-vehicle-services)
to see how to get a non-REAL ID-compliant license or state ID.
