How each branch of government provides checks and balances
----------------------------------------------------------

The ability of each branch to respond to the actions of the other branches is
[the system of checks and balances](https://bensguide.gpo.gov/j-check-balance)
.

Each branch of government can change acts of the other branches:

* The president can veto legislation created by Congress. He or she also nominates heads of federal agencies and high court appointees.
* Congress confirms or rejects the president's nominees. It can also remove the president from office in exceptional circumstances.
* The Justices of the Supreme Court, nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate, can overturn unconstitutional laws.
