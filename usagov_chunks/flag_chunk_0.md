**History of the American flag**
--------------------------------

The flag of the United States is a symbol of freedom before which Americans recite the
[pledge of allegiance.](https://bensguide.gpo.gov/liberty-bell-1753/35-age-4/apprentice-symbols-of-us-government/86-pledge-of-allegiance-1892)

The flag's 13 red and white stripes represent the 13 original colonies. Its 50 white stars on a blue background represent the 50 states.

Each of the colors on the flag has a meaning:

* Red: valor and bravery
* White: purity and innocence
* Blue: vigilance, perseverance, and justice

A star is added to the flag when a new state joins the United States. The flag was last modified on July 4, 1960, when Hawaii was incorporated as a state.
