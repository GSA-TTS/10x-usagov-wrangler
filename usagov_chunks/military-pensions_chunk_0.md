Military and veteran retirement benefits
========================================

If you retire from a career in the military, you may be eligible for a pension. The plan and benefits you will receive depend on your situation.

**Pension plans for active duty military**
------------------------------------------

There are two pension plans for active duty service members. These include:

* The Legacy or High 36 Retirement System
* Blended Retirement System (BRS)

Both plans require 20 or more years of service. The amount you receive from each plan is also based on the amount you earned from your basic pay and the date you joined the military.

[Find your basic pay amount](https://www.dfas.mil/militarymembers/payentitlements/Pay-Tables/)
based on your pay grade and the number of years you served.

If you joined the military:

* Before January 1, 2006 - You are in the legacy/high 36 retirement system.
* Between Jan 1, 2006, and December 31, 2017 - You had a choice of keeping the legacy/high 36 or choosing the BRS.
* After December 31, 2017 - You are in the BRS.
