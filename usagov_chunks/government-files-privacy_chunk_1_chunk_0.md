## Request information through the Privacy Act

To request records under the Privacy Act, you must contact the federal agency you believe holds the records.

When creating your request:

* Provide as many details as possible and explain:
  + What information you want
  + Why you believe the agency has information about you
  + When you believe the agency created the record
* Include proof of identity, such as a copy of your driver’s license.
* Ask about any fees you will owe for copies of your files.

Agencies typically group their Privacy Act and Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) offices together. When you write your request, address it to the agency’s or program’s FOIA/Privacy Act Officer, and state in your letter that it is a Privacy Act request.
