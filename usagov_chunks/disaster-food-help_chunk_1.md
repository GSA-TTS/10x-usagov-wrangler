D-SNAP eligibility for people who receive SNAP benefits
-------------------------------------------------------

If you receive SNAP benefits, you may still qualify for an additional amount. To get an increase in your benefits, you must:

* Receive less than the maximum amount for your family
* Have experienced a loss due to a disaster

The D-SNAP amount will increase your benefit to meet the maximum benefit for your family.

**How to apply for D-SNAP**
---------------------------

Each state sets its own process to apply for D-SNAP benefits. Contact your stateâ€™s SNAP office to learn how to apply.
