Presidential general election
=============================

Every four years, U.S. citizens vote for president and vice president during the general election. Learn how the presidential general election works.

**Presidential candidates**
---------------------------

Major political parties nominate presidential and vice presidential candidates at their party’s national convention. The candidates’ names will be listed on the general election ballot.

Candidates from minor political parties and independent candidates might not have a national convention. But they may be on the ballot, on a state-by-state basis, if they meet the eligibility requirements. This usually includes collecting a certain number of signatures on a petition for that state.
