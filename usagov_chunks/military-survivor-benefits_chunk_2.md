Military life insurance
-----------------------

Life insurance benefits pay money to survivors of a policyholder who dies. The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) offers life insurance to active duty service members and veterans. Other options provide coverage for qualifying injuries or service-connected disabilities. Learn more about what life insurance programs are available based on your situation.

### **Life insurance for active duty service members**

Qualifying active duty service members automatically have a policy with Servicemembers’ Group Life Insurance (SGLI).

, including:

* Eligibility requirements
* Updating your beneficiaries
* Changing or canceling your policy coverage

### **Life insurance for veterans**

If you had SGLI when you were on active duty, you may be eligible for the Veterans’ Group Life Insurance (VGLI). VGLI insures both active duty and reserve service veterans.
