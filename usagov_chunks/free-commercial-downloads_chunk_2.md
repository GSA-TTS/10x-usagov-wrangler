**Podcasts**
------------

These files have the extension ".xml" and ".php" and require installation and use of podcatching software (a type of aggregator).

You can download free podcatching software from:

* [Juice](https://juicereceiver.sourceforge.net/index.php)
  (PC, Mac, and Linux)
* [iTunes](https://www.apple.com/itunes/)
  (PC and Mac)

Podcasting is a method of publishing audio broadcasts via the internet, allowing users to subscribe to a feed of new audio files, usually MP3s. Listeners subscribe to feeds using podcatching software, which periodically checks for and downloads new content automatically. Any digital audio player or computer with audio-playing software can play podcasts.

**Other audio files**
---------------------

Some audio files on government websites have an ".au" extension. You can play these files using the standard sound player that comes with your device's operating system. For example,
[Windows Media Player](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-media-player-d10303a5-896c-2ce2-53d4-5bd5b9fd888b)
for Windows,
[QuickTime](https://support.apple.com/downloads/quicktime)
for the Macintosh, and
[XPlayGizmo](ftp://ftp.ncsa.uiuc.edu/Mosaic/Unix/viewers/xplaygizmo/)
for Unix. To hear audio on your computer, your system must also have speakers or earphones and a sound card.
