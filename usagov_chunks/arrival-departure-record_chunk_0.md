**How to apply for or see your current Form I-94**
--------------------------------------------------

Customs and Border Protection (CBP) typically issues Form I-94 electronically.

* If you are traveling by air or sea, a Customs and Border Protection officer will issue you an electronic I-94 at your point of entry during the admission process.
* If you are traveling by land, you can apply for an I-94 in person at your point of entry. Or you can apply within 7 days before entering the U.S. through the
  [official I-94 website](https://i94.cbp.dhs.gov/I94/#/home)
  or the
  [CBP One app](https://www.cbp.gov/about/mobile-apps-directory/cbpone)
  . When you do so, you will pay a $6 fee. This is a provisional I-94. It does not guarantee entry into the U.S.
