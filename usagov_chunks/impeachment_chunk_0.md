How federal impeachment works
=============================

Impeachment is the process of bringing charges against a government official for wrongdoing. A trial may be held, and the official may be removed from office.

**The impeachment process**
---------------------------

The Constitution gives Congress the power to impeach federal officials. An official can be impeached for treason, bribery, and “other high crimes and misdemeanors.”

1. The House of Representatives brings articles (charges) of impeachment against an official.
