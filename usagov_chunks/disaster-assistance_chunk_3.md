**Find assistance if the disaster you experienced was not federally declared**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The president of the United States decides which natural disasters are federally declared. In many cases, this decision is based on whether state and local governments in the disaster area can provide enough assistance to disaster survivors.

If the disaster you experienced was not declared an emergency federally, you may be eligible for help from other resources:

* You may be able to get free shelter and food through the Red Cross if it is offering assistance near you.
  [Find out if the Red Cross serves your community](https://www.redcross.org/get-help/disaster-relief-and-recovery-services/find-an-open-shelter.html)
  and get tips on what to pack if you need help.
* State and local governments may assist disaster survivors by providing food and shelter.
  [Contact your stateâ€™s social service agency](https://www.usa.gov/state-social-services)
  to find out what help you may qualify for.
