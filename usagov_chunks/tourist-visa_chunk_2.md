U.S. embassy visa renewal info

[Find the contact information for your nearest U.S. embassy or consulate](https://www.usembassy.gov/) and get information about visa renewals, including:

* Processing times  
* Fees  
* Your eligibility for an interview waiver

### Understand expiration dates for visas and I-94 forms

* The expiration date on your visa does not indicate the date on which you must depart the U.S.  
  + The date you must depart the U.S. will be shown on your Form I-94. This date is determined by the Customs and Border Protection officer when you arrive at the port-of-entry into the U.S.  
* You may renew your visitor visa before it expires. But you must renew it at a U.S. embassy or consulate in your home country.  
  + Only diplomatic visa holders and their dependents can renew their visas while they are in the U.S.
