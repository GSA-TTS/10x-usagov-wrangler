real estate tax payments

* **Real estate tax**
  - In most cases, you will pay your real estate tax to your local government instead of your state government. Your local government’s tax office assesses the value of your home, and the amount you pay can depend on your home’s market value, location, and condition.
* **Sales tax**
  - The sales tax you pay is based on a percentage of the sales price of an item you buy. Most states and municipalities have a sales tax and charge different percentages on different goods, or not at all for other items.
