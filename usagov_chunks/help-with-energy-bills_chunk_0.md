-----------------------------------------------------

The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) can help you pay your heating or cooling bills or get emergency services during an energy crisis. Depending on where you live, you may also qualify for help with electric bills.

Eligibility for LIHEAP is based on your income, and every state and territory has its own requirements. Answer a few questions to learn if you qualify, find your state or territoryâ€™s LIHEAP office, and apply. In some cases, you may be able to submit your LIHEAP application online. Other LIHEAP offices may require you to apply in person.
