## Complaints about travel agents and travel agencies

Begin by complaining to a local travel agency’s manager. If you are using an online booking service, complain to their customer service department. If your complaint is not resolved, you can contact:

- The [state consumer protection office](https://www.usa.gov/state-consumer) where you live or where the travel company is located
- Your local [Better Business Bureau](https://www.bbb.org/bbb-directory)
- [The Federal Trade Commission](https://reportfraud.ftc.gov/?orgcode=USAGOV)

## Complaints about cruises

- If you have a complaint while you are on a cruise, contact the ship’s guest services office.
- To complain before or after a cruise, contact the cruise line’s customer service department.

If the problem is not resolved, contact the Federal Maritime Commission by email at [complaints@fmc.gov](mailto:complaints@fmc.gov) or download, fill out, and mail or fax their [cruise dispute services request form](https://www.fmc.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/PVOForm32.pdf).
