Airline rules for unaccompanied minors
Letter of consent for child travel

If your child is traveling alone by air, the airline may require you to submit an unaccompanied minor form and pay a fee for unaccompanied minor service. This service provides an airline employee escort for your child at the airport and on board the plane. In addition, you and the person picking your child up at their destination may also need to provide the airline with identification and contact information.

Contact your airline before your childâ€™s trip to find out:

* What age requirements the airline has for their unaccompanied minor service
* If you can book a ticket with a connecting flight
* What documents and fees are required
