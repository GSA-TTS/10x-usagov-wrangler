### Dual citizenship if you are a U.S. citizen

If you are a U.S. citizen who is seeking dual citizenship, you must find out if the other country recognizes dual citizenship with the United States.

[Contact the other country's embassy or consulate](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/consularnotification/ConsularNotificationandAccess.html)
to learn if you are eligible.
