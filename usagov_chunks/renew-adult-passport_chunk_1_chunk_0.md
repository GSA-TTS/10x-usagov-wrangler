## How to renew your passport and what documents you will need

You can renew your passport and/or passport card by mail. You may instead be able to renew them online during the limited beta release of the Online Passport Renewal System.

Because it can take up to three months to process your application, it is important to renew your passport before it expires. Check with the Department of State to [find out the current processing times for passport renewals](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/how-apply/processing-times.html).
