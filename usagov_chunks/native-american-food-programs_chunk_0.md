# Food assistance for Native Americans

The Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR) provides monthly packages of healthy food. You may be eligible based on income, tribal membership, and where you live.

## Find out if you are eligible for food assistance through FDPIR benefits and apply

FDPIR works with state agencies and tribal organizations, which determine eligibility and provide food. You may be eligible if you:

* Meet income requirements  
* Live on a reservation  
* Live near a reservation or in Oklahoma, and someone in your household is a member of a federally recognized tribe  

Your tribal organization or regional Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) office can help you find out if you are eligible.

You can apply for food assistance by contacting your tribal organization or your regional Food and Nutrition Service (FNS) office.
