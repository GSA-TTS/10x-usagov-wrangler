**How to find loved ones after a disaster**
-------------------------------------------

If you are unable to locate friends or family members after a disaster, there are resources that can help:

* [DisasterAssistance.gov](https://www.disasterassistance.gov/information/immediate-needs/gathering-up-loved-ones)
  provides information about finding loved ones, unaccompanied children, and missing pets.
* [Get tips for contacting loved ones through your local Red Cross](https://www.redcross.org/get-help/disaster-relief-and-recovery-services/contact-and-locate-loved-ones.html)
  or a Red Cross chapter that serves the area affected by the disaster.
