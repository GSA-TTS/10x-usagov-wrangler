USAGov's product principles
How does USAGov show empathy?
USAGov accessibility and inclusion principles

USAGov shows care for the people who use our service, especially when they are upset or facing painful circumstances.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

We demonstrate empathy for our users by:

* Helping people access our services in less-than-ideal situations, such as during financial hardship or after a natural disaster
* Stating clearly when USAGov cannot provide direct assistance
* Valuing and improving the experience of USAGov staff, so we can remain empathetic as we serve people who need help from the government

USAGov empowers everyday people to navigate government.
-------------------------------------------------------

We empower people by:

* Helping users complete their tasks without taking away their decisions or independence
* Explaining what happens next, especially when users leave the USAGov environment
* Educating without patronizing, confusing, or minimizing
