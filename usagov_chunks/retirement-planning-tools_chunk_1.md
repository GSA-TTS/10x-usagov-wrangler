**Plan for Social Security retirement benefits**
------------------------------------------------

You can start receiving Social Security retirement benefits as early as age 62. But the later you wait to apply for benefits, the higher your payments will be. However, after age 70, your benefit amount no longer increases.

Sign in or create a personal
[*my*
Social Security account](https://www.ssa.gov/myaccount/)
to get an estimate of your future Social Security retirement benefits.

You can also use a variety of
[Social Security benefit calculators](https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/calculators/)
to find your full retirement age, estimate benefits for a spouse, and get a more detailed look at your future benefits.
