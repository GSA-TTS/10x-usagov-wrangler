If you applied for a visa, you can check your application status in the
[U.S. Department of State's Visa Status Check portal](https://ceac.state.gov/CEACStatTracker/Status.aspx).
To do so, select the type of visa you applied for (immigrant or nonimmigrant) and enter your case number.

**Check immigration case processing times**
-------------------------------------------

Even if you have not filed an application with USCIS, you can still find out how long processing may take by using
[USCISâ€™ case processing time tool](https://egov.uscis.gov/processing-times/).
When you use the tool, you will need to select:

* The form and form category you have filed or intend to file
* The USCIS office handling your case
