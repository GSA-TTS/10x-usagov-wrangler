**How to get financial assistance from the government**
-------------------------------------------------------

Federal assistance programs can provide financial help with living expenses or business costs. Use these free, official government resources to search for programs you might be eligible for:

* [USAGov’s benefit finder](https://www.usa.gov/benefit-finder) – Answer a few questions and get a personalized list of benefits you may qualify for. Learn about benefit programs and how to apply.
* [Grants.gov](https://www.grants.gov/) - Find funding opportunities for organizations that work with programs and projects funded by the government. Grants are usually not available for personal expenses or individual financial help.

Each program has its own eligibility rules, application process, and deadlines.
