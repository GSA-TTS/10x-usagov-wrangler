Branches of the U.S. government
===============================

Learn about the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of the U.S. government.

The Constitution of the United States divides the federal government into three branches: legislative, executive, and judicial. This ensures that no individual or group will have too much power.

Legislative branch

This branch is made up of
[Congress](https://www.congress.gov/members)

The legislative branchâ€™s roles include:
