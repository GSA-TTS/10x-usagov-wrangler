**Learn if you can collect Social Security benefits while living outside the U.S.**
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you earned Social Security benefits, you can visit or live in most foreign countries and still receive payments.
[Look up the country on the SSA Payments Abroad Screening Tool](https://www.ssa.gov/international/payments_outsideUS.html)
to find out if you can collect your Social Security payments or Social Security survivor benefits.

**Use work credits from another country to qualify for Social Security**
------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you worked outside the U.S., you may not have enough Social Security credits to qualify for Social Security retirement or disability benefits. But you may be able to count your work credits from another country.

[See if the country you have worked in has a retirement benefit agreement with the United States.](https://www.ssa.gov/international/agreements_overview.html)
