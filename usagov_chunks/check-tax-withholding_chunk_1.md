**Decide how much tax to withhold**
-----------------------------------

The more taxes you withhold from your pay, the less you may owe when your tax bill is due. Knowing when to increase or decrease the amount of taxes withheld from your paycheck can depend on:

* How many jobs you have
* If you have income from outside your job that is not subject to withholding
* If you are eligible for income tax credits or deductions
