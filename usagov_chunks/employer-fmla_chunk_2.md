Employer responsibilities under the FMLA
FMLA eligibility notice for employees
FMLA rights and responsibilities notice

### Eligibility notice

The first time an employee requests leave under the FMLA, you must give them a notice of eligibility, either orally or in writing. The notice must:

* Be given five days from the date of the leave request
* Inform them whether or not they are eligible for the FMLA
* Include at least one reason why they do not qualify for leave, if they are not eligible for the FMLA

### Rights and responsibilities notice

If you give a worker an eligibility notice, you must also give them a rights and responsibilities notice. Provide this notice in writing. It can be an electronic copy.

[Complete the Department of Labor's Form WH-381](https://www.dol.gov/sites/dolgov/files/WHD/legacy/files/WH-381.pdf)
to meet this Rights and Responsibilities Notice requirement.
