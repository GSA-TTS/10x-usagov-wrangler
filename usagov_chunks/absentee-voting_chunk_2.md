#### **How to change your address if you are an absentee or vote-by-mail voter**

If you have moved, you must update your voter registration with your new address before requesting an absentee or vote-by-mail ballot. In some states, you may need to submit a new voter registration form. In other states, there may be a form you can sign and mail letting your stateâ€™s election office know your address has changed. Or you may be able to change your address online. Contact your
[state or local election office](https://www.usvotefoundation.org/election-offices)
to find out how to update your address.

#### **Know your options for returning your absentee or vote-by-mail ballot**

Check with your
[state or local election office](https://www.usvotefoundation.org/vote/eoddomestic.htm)
to learn about other ways to return your ballot besides postal mail. Some states have ballot drop boxes. Many let you return your ballot in person at your local election office or another location.
