**Visit someone in federal prison**
-----------------------------------

The Bureau of Prisons (BOP) recommends completing these four steps before visiting someone in federal prison:

1. Find out which prison the person you are visiting is in.
2. Get approval from the prison to visit.
3. Review the prison’s rules and regulations before visiting.
4. View the prison’s visiting schedule and find out how to get there.
