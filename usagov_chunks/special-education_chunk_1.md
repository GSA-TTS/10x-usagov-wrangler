how to get an IEP for my child

**Special education services**
------------------------------

Special education services are designed to meet the needs of students with disabilities. When students qualify for special education, they receive an Individualized Education Program (IEP). The IEP plans out instruction and resources to best support each child. These resources are available at no cost to families.

* If you have concerns about your child’s development, you can request an evaluation through your local school district. Your child can be evaluated even if they do not attend public school.

**Where else to get help**
--------------------------

* You may be able to find additional educational support services in your state through Parent Training and Information Centers (PTIs). They provide information and services for children and young adults from birth to age 26 and their families.
