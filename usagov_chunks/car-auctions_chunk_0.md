Government vehicle auctions
===========================

The government auctions thousands of motor vehicles each year. Some are government-owned and are in prime condition. Others the government seized and may need many repairs.

Auctions may take place online, in person, or by mail-in bid. The federal agency that owns the vehicles may conduct the auction or it may contract with an auction company to conduct the sales.
