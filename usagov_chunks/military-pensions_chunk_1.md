### **Determine your military pension plan and calculate your pay**

[Legacy or High 36 Retirement System](https://militarypay.defense.gov/Pay/Retirement/)
- This plan is based on an average of your highest 36 months of basic pay. The government does not match your contributions to the Thrift Savings plan.

[Blended Retirement System (BRS)](https://militarypay.defense.gov/BlendedRetirement/)
- The government matches your contributions to the Thrift Savings Plan up to 4%. You will also receive a pension based on an average of your highest 36 months of basic pay.

**Retirement plans for reserve service members**
------------------------------------------------

Retiring reservists with an accumulation of 20 or more years of service typically begin receiving their retirement benefits at age 60. But you may still qualify if you are under 60 based on the time you spent in active duty.

Payments will not begin automatically. Request your retirement benefits from the department where you last served.
