# Electoral College

The Electoral College decides who will be elected president and vice president of the U.S. Learn who is involved and how the process works.

**What is the Electoral College?**

The Electoral College is not a physical place. It is a process which includes the:

* Selection of electors  
* Meeting of electors who cast votes for the president and vice president  
* Counting of the electorsâ€™ votes by Congress  

In other U.S. elections, candidates are elected directly by popular vote. But the president and vice president are not elected directly by citizens. Instead, they are chosen through the Electoral College process.

The process of using electors comes from the Constitution. It was a compromise between a popular vote by citizens and a vote in Congress.
