The Privacy Act gives you the right to see and correct your information that the federal government keeps on file. Learn your rights under the act and how to request information.

What is the Privacy Act?
------------------------

[The Privacy Act of 1974](https://www.justice.gov/opcl/privacy-act-1974)
ensures that federal agencies are fair in the way they collect, maintain, use, and distribute information they have about U.S. citizens and permanent residents. Agencies get this information when they create records if you pay income taxes, serve in the military, apply for a federal benefit, or directly interact with the government in other ways.

Your rights under the Privacy Act
---------------------------------

The Privacy Act of 1974 guarantees your right to:

* See records about your personal information, subject to the actâ€™s exemptions
* Correct a record that is inaccurate or incomplete unless it is exempt
* Sue the government for violating the law for improper disclosures
