# Home repair programs for Native Americans, veterans, and rural residents

If you are American Indian or Alaska Native, a veteran, or live in a rural area, you may qualify for home repair help from the government. Learn about eligibility and how to apply.

**Important**

The federal government does not offer “free money” to individuals to repair or improve their homes. Websites and ads claiming to offer “free money from the government” are often scams.

**Home repair programs for American Indians and Alaska Natives**

If you are an American Indian tribal member or Alaska Native with a very low income, you may qualify for help through the Housing Improvement Program (HIP).

* [Learn about eligibility and how to apply for HIP.](https://www.bia.gov/bia/ois/dhs/housing-program)
