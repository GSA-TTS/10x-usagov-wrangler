=================================

Renouncing and losing your citizenship both result in no longer being a U.S. citizen. Learn how to voluntarily renounce your citizenship or how you might involuntarily lose it.

**What happens when you renounce or lose your U.S. citizenship**
----------------------------------------------------------------

Renouncing or losing your citizenship both happen under very limited circumstances. Both mean that you:

* No longer have rights and responsibilities as a U.S. citizen. But you may still be:
  + [Subject to tax payments](https://www.irs.gov/instructions/i8854)
  + Eligible for Social Security benefits
* Must become a citizen of another nation or risk becoming "stateless"
* May need a visa to return to the U.S.
