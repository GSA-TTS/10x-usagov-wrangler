**Home repair programs for veterans**

If you are a U.S. military veteran or service member, you may be eligible for:

* [Cash-out refinance loans](https://www.va.gov/housing-assistance/home-loans/loan-types/cash-out-loan/), which can be used to pay for home repairs and improvements.
* [Disability housing grants](https://www.va.gov/housing-assistance/disability-housing-grants/) for veterans with qualifying service-connected disabilities. These grants can help pay to buy or modify a home for independent living.
* [Home Improvements and Structural Alterations (HISA) grants](https://www.prosthetics.va.gov/psas/HISA2.asp) for medically necessary home improvements. These could include wider doors or accessible bathrooms.

**Home repair programs for rural residents**

If you live in a rural area and have a very low income, you may qualify for single-family housing repair loans and grants. The Section 504 Home Repair program provides funds to improve or modernize your home or remove health and safety hazards.
