### Types of primaries and caucuses

Depending on state and political party rules, primaries and caucuses can be "open," "closed," or some hybrid of the two.

* During an open primary or caucus, voters do not have to be registered with a political party to take part in its primary or caucus.
* During a closed primary or caucus, only voters registered with that party can take part and vote.
* "Semi-open" and "semi-closed" primaries and caucuses are variations of the two main types.

Each state has its own way of operating its primaries and caucuses.
