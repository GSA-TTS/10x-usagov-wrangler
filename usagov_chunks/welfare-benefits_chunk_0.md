Welfare benefits or Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)
==================================================================

If you or your family are experiencing financial hardship, find out how you can get help paying for food, housing, and more.

**What is TANF?**
-----------------

Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) is a federally funded, state-run program. Also known as welfare, TANF helps families pay for:

* Food  
* Housing  
* Home energy  
* Child care  

In addition to cash assistance for living expenses, many states offer job training and help with tuition payments for work-related education.

Each state or tribal government runs its TANF program differently and has a different name.
