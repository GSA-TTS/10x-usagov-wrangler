**What is wrongful termination?**
---------------------------------

Your termination could be wrongful if your employer fired you:

* Due to discrimination
* In violation of a federal or state labor law
* Because you reported and refused to participate in harassment
* Because you reported and refused to conduct an illegal act or safety violation

Termination could also be considered wrongful if your employer fired you but did not follow their termination policies.
