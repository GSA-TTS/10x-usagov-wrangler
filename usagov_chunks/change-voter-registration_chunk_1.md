**Change your political party affiliation**
-------------------------------------------

Your political party affiliation is the party that you choose to associate with. Depending on your state, you may be asked your party affiliation when you register to vote and it may be listed on your voter registration card. In some states, you can change your political party affiliation online.

Change the party listed on your registration through your
[state election office](https://www.usa.gov/state-election-office)
. Before you do, know:

* You do not have to join a political party or reveal your party preference when you register to vote.
* Not every state accepts or lists a party affiliation on a voter registration card.
* The party affiliation on your voter registration does not limit you to voting for just that party. You can always choose to vote for a candidate from any party in a general election, like a presidential, congressional, or mayoral election.

Your party affiliation is usually only important in primary elections. Many states have "closed" primaries. This means you can only vote for your partyâ€™s candidates in its primary election.
