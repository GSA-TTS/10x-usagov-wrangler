Small business funding options
SBA loans for minorities

**Funding your small business**  
Businesses need money to start and grow. And they may need money to recover after a disaster. There are  
[no federal grants for starting a business](https://www.usa.gov/no-free-money). But  
[small business owners can get money](https://www.sba.gov/business-guide/plan-your-business/fund-your-business) in different ways. This includes using personal funds, finding investors, or taking out loans.  

The SBA also has funding for groups such as:  

* [Women-owned businesses](https://www.sba.gov/business-guide/grow-your-business/women-owned-businesses)  
* [Minority-owned businesses](https://www.sba.gov/business-guide/grow-your-business/minority-owned-businesses)  
* [Native American-owned businesses](https://www.sba.gov/business-guide/grow-your-business/native-american-owned-businesses)  
* [Veteran-owned businesses](https://www.sba.gov/business-guide/grow-your-business/veteran-owned-businesses)
