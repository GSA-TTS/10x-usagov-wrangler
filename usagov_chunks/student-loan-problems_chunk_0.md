Resolve student loan payment problems
=====================================

If you are struggling to repay your student loan, contact your loan servicer. Not paying your student loan has serious consequences. Learn how to get your payments back on track.

**Student loan deferment and forbearance**
------------------------------------------

If you are having trouble paying back your student loans, you may qualify for:

* Loan deferment - Payments are postponed. In most cases, the interest money you owe will continue to accrue (grow).
* Forbearance - Payments are suspended or reduced, but the interest you owe continues to accrue.

Both give you a temporary pause in your loan payments.
