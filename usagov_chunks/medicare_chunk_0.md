**What is Medicare, and how does it work?**

Medicare is the federal health insurance program for people who are 65 and over. If you are under 65, you may be eligible to get Medicare earlier if you have a disability, End-Stage Renal Disease (ESRD), or ALS (Lou Gehrigâ€™s Disease).

Medicare is divided into four parts:

* [Medicare Part A](https://www.medicare.gov/what-medicare-covers/what-part-a-covers) is insurance for hospitalization, home or skilled nursing, and hospice.
* [Medicare Part B](https://www.medicare.gov/what-medicare-covers/what-part-b-covers) is medical insurance.
  + [Learn about canceling Medicare Part A or Part B coverage](https://www.medicare.gov/basics/get-started-with-medicare/sign-up/ready-to-sign-up-for-part-a-part-b/how-to-drop-part-a-part-b), including its risks. Or, if you are ready to cancel your coverage, you can submit [CMS Form 1763](https://www.cms.gov/medicare/cms-forms/cms-forms/downloads/cms1763.pdf) to your local Social Security office.
