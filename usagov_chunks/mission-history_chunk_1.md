USAGov history
--------------

The USAGov program has existed under various names for over 50 years, dating back to the Federal Information Center call centers in the 1960s and the Consumer Information Center, distributing government consumer booklets from Pueblo, Colorado beginning in the early 1970s.

through decades of cultural and technological change.

The history of the USA.gov website
----------------------------------

Many people and organizations had a hand in creating this comprehensive portal to government.

USA.gov got its start when internet entrepreneur Eric Brewer offered to donate a powerful search engine to the U.S. government in 1999. That gift helped speed up the government's earlier work to create a government-wide portal. And in 2000, USA.gov went live under the name FirstGov.gov.

The General Services Administration and 22 federal agencies funded the initiative in 2001 and 2002. Since 2002, USA.gov has received an annual appropriation from the U.S. Congress.

USAGov’s Spanish language website was first launched in October 2003 as FirstGov.gov en Español. Later, it was renamed GobiernoUSA.gov and then to its current name, [USAGov en Español](https://www.usa.gov/es/).

In January 2007, FirstGov.gov officially changed its name to USA.gov.
