What to do if selected in DV Lottery

You must remember to check the DV lottery results yourself online using your confirmation number. If your confirmation number is lost, [learn how you can retrieve it](https://dvprogram.state.gov/ESC/CheckConfirmation.aspx).

Be aware that:

* The Department of State will not send you a letter or an email to let you know if you have been selected. See the fraud warning above.
* Being selected in the DV Lottery does not guarantee you will receive a visa. Selection means you can move forward in the DV Program.
