## Complaints about a hotel or motel

- Begin by sharing your complaint with the front desk, manager, or customer service line.
- If you feel your issue was not resolved, contact the regional manager or another senior executive if the hotel or motel is part of a chain.
- Depending on the type of complaint, if it is not resolved, you may also contact the local health department or the [state consumer protection office](https://www.usa.gov/state-consumer).
