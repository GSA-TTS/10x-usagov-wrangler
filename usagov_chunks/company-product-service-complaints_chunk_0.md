How to file a complaint about a company’s products or services
================================================================

If you have an issue with a product or service, learn the steps to file a complaint with the company. Or get consumer or legal help if you cannot resolve your complaint.

Collect documents related to your purchase
------------------------------------------

Before you make a complaint, gather any documentation about the sale of the product or service first. These documents can include:

* Sales receipts
* Warranties
* Contracts
* Work orders
* Email messages or records of any contact you have had with the seller

Contact the company about your complaint
----------------------------------------

If you have a complaint about a company’s products or services, contact them first before you seek help elsewhere. Explain your problem to the company by calling, web chatting, or sending them a formal complaint letter.

Use this
[sample complaint letter](https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/sample-customer-complaint-letter)
as a guide to help you explain the problem and what you want done to resolve it. Then send it to:

* A salesperson or customer service representative. Search for a company’s customer service contact information on their website. Look for links that say "contact us," "customer service," "about us," or "privacy statement."
* Take your complaint to a company's management if a salesperson or customer service representative did not help.
