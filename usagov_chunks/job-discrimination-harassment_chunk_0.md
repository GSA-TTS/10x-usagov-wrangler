How to report workplace discrimination

Discrimination, harassment, and retaliation
===========================================

Federal and state laws protect you from unfair and unwelcome treatment at work. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and states enforce discrimination and harassment laws.

**Workplace discrimination**
----------------------------

Discrimination happens when an employer treats an employee or job applicant unfairly because of their race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age (40 or older), disability, or genetic information.

EEOC laws do not cover all employers. Coverage is often based on the number of employees.
[Verify if your employer is required to follow the EEOC's rules.](https://www.eeoc.gov/coverage)

### Report workplace discrimination

Report discrimination to the EEOC.
[Use the EEOC's public portal to follow the complaint process.](https://publicportal.eeoc.gov/Portal/Login.aspx)
