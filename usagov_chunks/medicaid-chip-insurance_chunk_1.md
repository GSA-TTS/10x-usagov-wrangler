How to apply for Medicaid
-------------------------

You can apply for Medicaid anytime in one of the following ways:

* [Find and check with your state's Medicaid agency](https://www.medicaid.gov/about-us/where-can-people-get-help-medicaid-chip)
  to apply. You must be a resident of the state where you are applying for benefits.
* [Create an account with the Health Insurance Marketplace](https://www.healthcare.gov/create-account)
  and fill out an application. If it looks like anyone in your household qualifies for Medicaid, your information will be sent to your state agency. They will contact you about enrollment.

### **What documents and information do you need for your Medicaid application?**

When you apply for Medicaid, you may need to provide certain information or documentation. But what is required depends on your state. Your state Medicaid agency may ask for:

* Your name and date of birth
* Your Social Security number
* Your monthly payment amounts for rent, mortgage, or utilities
* Proof of citizenship or immigration status
* Proof of income, like paystubs or W-2s
* A verification of what other government benefits you receive
* Information about an insurance plan your employer has offered you or an insurance plan you currently have

to learn what documentation they require.
