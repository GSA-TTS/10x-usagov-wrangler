Prove your citizenship: born in the U.S. with no birth certificate
==================================================================

If you were born in the U.S. and have no birth certificate, learn how to get documentation to prove you are a U.S. citizen.

Contact the
[vital records office in your birth state](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/w2w/index.htm?CDC_AA_refVal=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdc.gov%2Fnchs%2Fw2w.htm)
so they can search for a record of your birth. If they cannot find your birth record, they will issue you a Letter of No Record, which includes:

* Your name
* Your date of birth
* The years searched by the vital records office to find your birth record
* Confirmation that they were unable to find a birth certificate on file
