**Past impeachments of federal officials**
------------------------------------------

The House has initiated impeachment proceedings more than 60 times. But there have been only 21 impeachments. This includes three presidents, one cabinet secretary, and one senator. Of those who were impeached, only eight officials were found guilty by the Senate and removed from office. All eight were federal judges.

The presidents impeached by the House were:

* [Andrew Johnson](https://www.archives.gov/legislative/features/impeachment)
  in 1868
* [William Jefferson (Bill) Clinton](https://www.clintonlibrary.gov/research/clinton-biographies)
  in 1998
* [Donald John Trump in 2019](https://www.congress.gov/congressional-report/116th-congress/house-report/346/1)
  and
  [2021](https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/house-resolution/24/text)

Presidents Johnson, Clinton, and Trump remained in office following acquittals by the Senate on all charges.

Former President Richard Nixon was not impeached. He resigned after Congress started the impeachment process against him in 1974.
