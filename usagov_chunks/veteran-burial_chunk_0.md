Veteran burial in a national cemetery
=====================================

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) offers burial in national cemeteries for qualifying veterans and spouses. In some cases, their child may also be eligible.

**Eligibility for burial in a national cemetery**
-------------------------------------------------

To qualify for burial in a national cemetery, a veteran or their dependents must meet the VA’s eligibility requirements.

* Veterans - Check for eligibility based on the veteran’s discharge status and when and where they served.
* Family members - Spouses may qualify even if the veteran they married died and the spouse remarried. Both minor and unmarried adult children who qualify as dependents of a veteran may also be eligible for burial.
