What is Congress?
-----------------

The U.S. Congress is the legislative branch of the U.S. government. It is composed of two chambers, the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate. Congressional elections determine who represents your state in the federal government and which political party will hold a majority in each chamber for the next two years.

**How congressional elections work**
------------------------------------

Congressional elections happen every two years. At that time, one-third of the Senate and every seat in the House of Representatives is up for election.

Midterm congressional elections take place halfway between presidential elections. The most recent congressional elections were in November 2022. The next midterm elections will be in November 2026.
