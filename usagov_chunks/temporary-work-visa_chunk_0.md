There are many temporary worker visa classifications. These include H-1B for specialized occupations and H-2A for seasonal agriculture work. The amount of time you can work temporarily in the U.S. depends on the visa you qualify for.

Before you apply for any of these visas, your prospective employer must first file a petition with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) on your behalf. After your employerâ€™s petition is approved, you will be able to apply for a temporary work visa.
