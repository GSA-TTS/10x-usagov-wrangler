**Get dual citizenship**
------------------------

Your eligibility to become a dual citizen depends on the policies of the second country where you are applying for citizenship.

### Dual citizenship if you are a citizen of another country

Some countries allow people to keep their citizenship after becoming U.S. citizens, while others do not.

[Contact the other countryâ€™s embassy or consulate](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/consularnotification/ConsularNotificationandAccess.html)
to find out if they recognize dual U.S. citizenship.

If you qualify for dual citizenship, you must first immigrate to the U.S. Then you must become a permanent U.S. resident before being eligible for U.S. citizenship.
