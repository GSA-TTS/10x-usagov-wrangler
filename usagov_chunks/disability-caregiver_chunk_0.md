Get paid as a caregiver for a family member
===========================================

Some government programs pay family or friends of people with disabilities to help with daily activities, including personal care, giving medicine, cooking, cleaning, and more.

**Become a paid caregiver through a state Medicaid program**
------------------------------------------------------------

If someone with a disability already receives Medicaid, their state may allow a family member or friend to become a paid caregiver.

Many states call this a consumer-directed personal assistance program. Each state has different requirements and rules. And the amount the program pays you to care for a family member varies by state.
