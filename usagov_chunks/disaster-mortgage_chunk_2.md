### **Learn how to get an FHA mortgage to replace your home**

The FHA makes it easier to get a mortgage to rebuild or buy a new home.

[The FHA offers mortgage insurance](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/housing/sfh/ins/203h-dft)
if your home is destroyed in a disaster. Under this program:

* You will not have to make a down payment.
* You will pay the FHA mortgage insurance as part of your mortgage payment.

Contact an FHA-approved lender to apply for an FHA disaster mortgage.
