----------------------------------------------

Before planning your trip abroad, you can find out if there are any travel advisories in your destination country. These advisories are issued by the U.S. Department of State and include 4 levels of increasing risk:

* Level 1 - Exercise normal caution. This is the lowest level of risk. But be aware that there is some risk with international travel, and safe conditions in some countries may differ from those in the U.S.
* Level 2 - Exercise increased caution. A level 2 alert means you should be aware of heightened risk when you travel.
* Level 3 - Reconsider travel. There may be serious risks involved when you travel to countries under a level 3 alert.
* Level 4 - Do not travel. In countries under a level 4 travel advisory, there is a higher chance you may encounter life-threatening risks. The U.S. government may also not have the ability to assist you if you experience an emergency.
