**When to fly the flag at half-staff**
--------------------------------------

The American flag flies at half-staff or at half-mast when the country or a state is in mourning. The president, a state governor, or the mayor of the District of Columbia can order flags to fly at half-staff.

In most cases, an American flag flying at half-staff marks one of three observances:

* The death of a government official, military member, or emergency first responder
* A national tragedy
* Memorial Day or another national day of remembrance
