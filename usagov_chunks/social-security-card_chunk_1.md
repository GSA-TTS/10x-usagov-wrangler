### **Get a Social Security number and card for a new baby**

The easiest time to apply for a Social Security number for your baby is at the hospital after they are born. Request one when you give the information for your child's birth certificate.

If you do not want to request one in the hospital,
[begin an application for your childâ€™s Social Security number online](https://secure.ssa.gov/ossnap/public/landingOSsnap)

Your child will need their own Social Security number so you can:

* Claim them as a dependent on your income tax return
* Open a bank account in their name
* Get medical coverage for them
* Apply for government services for them
