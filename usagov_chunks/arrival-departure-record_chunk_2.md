Form I-94 arrival-departure record for U.S. visitors
Is Form I-94W still used for Visa Waiver travelers?
ESTA requirements for U.S. entry

**I-94W no longer used for travelers under the Visa Waiver Program through ESTA**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Citizens of
[Visa Waiver Program](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/tourism-visit/visa-waiver-program.html)
countries must have an approved and current authorization through the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) to enter the United States. However, the use of Form I-94W was discontinued after CBP began processing travelers using ESTA. If you are eligible for the Visa Waiver Program, CBP encourages you to apply for Form I-94 instead, through the
[official I-94 website](https://i94.cbp.dhs.gov/I94/#/home)
or the
[CBP One app](https://www.cbp.gov/about/mobile-apps-directory/cbpone)
