The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) offers food assistance for older adults who have a low income. These programs include:

* [Senior Farmers Market Nutrition Program (SFMNP)](https://www.fns.usda.gov/sfmnp/senior-farmers-market-nutrition-program)
  - Provides coupons for fresh fruits, vegetables, honey, and herbs. You can use the coupons at farmers markets, roadside stands, and community farms.
* [Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP)](https://www.fns.usda.gov/csfp/applicant-recipient)
  - Provides a monthly package of healthy food. USDA distributes food to local agencies where you can pick it up. In some states, you may be eligible to have your food delivered.
