Where to file a complaint about your car
========================================

Learn where to file a complaint about your car if you cannot get your issue resolved with the dealer, auto loan company, or manufacturer.

The federal or state agency you contact will depend on the nature of your complaint. Some agencies will investigate your complaint. Others accept complaints so they can file a case against the company in the future.
