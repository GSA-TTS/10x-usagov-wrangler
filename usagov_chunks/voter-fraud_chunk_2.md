What are the types of voter and election crimes?
------------------------------------------------

Federal election crimes fall into three broad categories:

* **Campaign finance crimes**
  , such as when candidates accept funds that violate the amounts or donors permitted under the law
* **Voter fraud and voter registration fraud**
  , such as when someone illegally casts a vote in the name of a dead person or someone who has moved. Many states have strengthened their
  [voter ID requirements](https://www.usa.gov/voter-id)
  to help stop voter fraud.
* **Civil rights violations**
  involving voter intimidation, coercion, threats, and other tactics to suppress a personâ€™s ability to vote

You have the right to cast your vote in private. There is no law against asking someone who they are voting for. But you do not have to share that information with anyone if you do not want to.
