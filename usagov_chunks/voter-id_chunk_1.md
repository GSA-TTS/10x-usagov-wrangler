**Procedures for voting without ID**
------------------------------------

Even if you do not have a form of ID that your state asks for, you may be able to vote.

Some states may ask you to sign a form affirming your identity.
[Find out if you can vote in your state without ID](https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/voter-verification-without-id-documents)
and what information you may need to provide when you vote.

Other states will let you cast a provisional ballot.

* States use provisional ballots when there is a question about a voter's eligibility.
* They keep your provisional ballot separate until they investigate your eligibility. You may have to return to show an acceptable form of ID within a few days, or the ballot will not count.
