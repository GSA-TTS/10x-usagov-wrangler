         Get help paying medical bills through debt management

       <p>
        In some cases, you may be able to get help paying your medical bills with a debt management plan. This involves a payment schedule that a credit counselor develops based on your situation. When you make a payment, your money is deposited into an account with the credit counseling organization, which then pays your debt. You may be able to get lower interest rates and certain fees waived to help make it easier to pay off your medical debt.
