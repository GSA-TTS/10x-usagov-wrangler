How to get veterans health benefits
===================================

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) offers health care to eligible veterans and their dependents. Find out if you are eligible, how to apply, and where to get medical care.

**What do VA health benefits include?**
---------------------------------------

Basic VA health benefits cover:

* Preventive care, such as health exams and immunizations
* Inpatient hospital services, including surgery
* Urgent and emergency care
* Assisted living and home health care
* Prescriptions

Some veterans receive additional benefits such as dental care. This depends on your service history, income, and if you have a disability.

The benefit amount and the type of care each veteran receives can vary.

**VA health benefits eligibility**
----------------------------------

Your eligibility for VA health benefits depends on your:

* Discharge status
* Service-connected disability
* Time on active duty

Read the
[VA health eligibility requirements](https://www.va.gov/health-care/eligibility/)
to see if you could receive benefits.

**How to apply for VA health benefits**
---------------------------------------

You can apply for VA health benefits online, by phone or mail, or in person.

**Health benefits for military dependents**
-------------------------------------------

There are several health benefit programs that spouses, children, survivors, and family caregivers may qualify for. The most common ones for dependents are:

* The Civilian Health and Medical Program of the Department of Veterans Affairs (CHAMPVA)
* TRICARE

While CHAMPVA and TRICARE are similar, each program has its own eligibility requirements. In some cases, dependents may be eligible for both programs, but they cannot be used together to cover health care costs.

In addition to CHAMPVA and TRICARE, there are other health benefits with more specific eligibility requirements.

**Find out where to get medical care through the VA**
-----------------------------------------------------

Veterans and their dependents can receive medical care at VA medical centers and clinics.

If you do not live near a VA medical facility, you may be able to get care from a local provider through the VA.
