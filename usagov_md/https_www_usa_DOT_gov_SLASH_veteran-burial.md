Veteran burial in a national cemetery
=====================================

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) offers burial in national cemeteries for qualifying veterans and spouses. In some cases, their child may also be eligible.

**Eligibility for burial in a national cemetery**
-------------------------------------------------

To qualify for burial in a national cemetery, a veteran or their dependents must meet the VAâs eligibility requirements.

* Veterans - Check for eligibility based on the veteranâs discharge status and when and where they served.
* Family members - Spouses may qualify even if the veteran they married died and the spouse remarried. Both minor and unmarried adult children who qualify as dependents of a veteran may also be eligible for burial.

**Pre-apply for burial in a national cemetery**
-----------------------------------------------

You can find out in advance if you can be buried in a national cemetery. Follow the
[steps to apply for pre-need eligibility for burial in a VA national cemetery](https://www.va.gov/burials-memorials/pre-need-eligibility/)
.

You may
[apply online](https://www.va.gov/burials-and-memorials/pre-need/form-10007-apply-for-eligibility/introduction)
or
[download and mail your application [PDF, 136KB]](https://www.va.gov/vaforms/va/pdf/VA40-10007.pdf)
to:

NCA Intake Center
  
P.O. Box 5237
  
Janesville, WI 53547

If the VA approves your application, you will receive a pre-need decision letter. Share this letter with your family to make the burial process easier.

**Schedule burial in a national cemetery**
------------------------------------------

The burial scheduling process depends on if the deceased person previously received a pre-need decision letter.

Various U.S. states and government agencies, including the VA, maintain veterans cemeteries where your loved one may be eligible for burial. Arlington National Cemetery and the United States Soldiers' & Airmen's Home National Cemetery are maintained by the Department of the Army.

Keep in mind that the VA cannot guarantee burial in a specific cemetery.

### **Scheduling with a pre-need decision letter**

If there is a pre-need letter, a loved one or funeral director can request the burial. Call the National Cemetery Scheduling Office at 1-800-535-1117.

### **Scheduling without a pre-need decision letter**

[Without a pre-need letter, follow the VAâs three steps to schedule a burial.](https://www.va.gov/burials-memorials/schedule-a-burial/)
