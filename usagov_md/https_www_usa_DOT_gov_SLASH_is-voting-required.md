Is voting mandatory in the U.S.?
================================

In the U.S., no one is required by law to vote in any local, state, or presidential election.

[Amendments to the U.S. Constitution and the creation of the Voting Rights Act](https://www.archives.gov/news/topics/voting-rights)
extended and strengthened voting rights. But there are no laws making voting mandatory for U.S. citizens.
