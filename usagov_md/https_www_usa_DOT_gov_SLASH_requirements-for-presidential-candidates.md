Constitutional requirements for presidential candidates
=======================================================

Candidates for president of the United States must meet basic requirements. Learn about the criteria to run for president.

The U.S. Constitution states that the president must:

* Be a natural-born citizen of the United States
* Be at least 35 years old
* Have been a resident of the United States for 14 years

Anyone who meets these requirements can declare their candidacy for president. Once a candidate raises or spends more than $5,000 for their campaign, they must register with the Federal Election Commission. That includes naming a principal campaign committee to raise and spend campaign funds.
