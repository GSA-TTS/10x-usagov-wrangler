===============================================================================

If you are not a U.S. citizen and do not have a Social Security number, learn how to get and use an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) to file a federal tax return.

**What is an ITIN, and how does it work?**
------------------------------------------

An Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN) is a 9-digit number the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) issues to people filing a tax return who are not U.S. citizens and do not have or are not eligible for a Social Security number. You can only use your ITIN for tax reporting purposes.

**How to apply for an ITIN**
----------------------------

There are 3 ways you can apply for an ITIN number:

* Fill out
  [Form W-7](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-w-7)
  , Application for IRS Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN), and submit it with your tax return.
* Contact an IRS-authorized Certifying Acceptance Agent.

If your ITIN has expired, you must renew it either in person, by mail, or by submitting Form W-7 with your tax return.
