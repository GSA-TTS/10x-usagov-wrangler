Form I-94 arrival-departure record for U.S. visitors
====================================================

Form I-94 records the arrival and departure dates of people visiting the U.S.

**Who needs an I-94 form?**
---------------------------

Everyone entering the U.S. needs an I-94 form except:

* American citizens
* Returning resident aliens
* Non-U.S. citizens with immigrant visas
* Most Canadian citizens who are visiting or in transit

**How to apply for or see your current Form I-94**
--------------------------------------------------

Customs and Border Protection (CBP) typically issues Form I-94 electronically.

* If you are traveling by air or sea, a Customs and Border Protection officer will issue you an electronic I-94 at your point of entry during the admission process.
* If you are traveling by land, you can apply for an I-94 in person at your point of entry. Or you can apply within 7 days before entering the U.S. through the
  [official I-94 website](https://i94.cbp.dhs.gov/I94/#/home)
  or the
  [CBP One app](https://www.cbp.gov/about/mobile-apps-directory/cbpone)
  . When you do so, you will pay a $6 fee. This is a provisional I-94. It does not guarantee entry into the U.S.

With the CBP One app or I-94 website, you can also:

* See your most recent I-94 form and print it, in case you need your record of legal admission to the U.S. The CBP One app also allows you to have a digital version of your I-94 on your phone.
* Get a travel history from the last 10 years of your arrivals and departures from the U.S.
* Find out how long you are legally allowed to stay in the US
* Read frequently asked questions about the I-94

Customs and Border Protection (CBP) sends visitors email reminders about their remaining time in the U.S. In addition, it sends notifications to travelers who may have exceeded their admission period.

**Departing the U.S. with Form I-94**
-------------------------------------

In most cases, your departure from the U.S. will be recorded electronically, whether you are traveling by air, land, or sea.

### Unusual I-94 departure situations

* If your Form I-94 was issued to you on paper, you must give it to the airline or a CBP officer when you depart the U.S.
* If you received your I-94 electronically when you entered the U.S. by air, land, or sea, but plan to depart by land to Canada or Mexico, your exit may not be recorded properly. This issue may occur if you are not a Canadian or Mexican citizen and you depart by land and re-enter the U.S. after the expiration date stamped in your passport. In this case, you may want to travel with evidence of your land departure, including:
  + Entry stamps in your passport
  + Transportation tickets
  + Other receipts

**I-94W no longer used for travelers under the Visa Waiver Program through ESTA**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Citizens of
[Visa Waiver Program](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/tourism-visit/visa-waiver-program.html)
countries must have an approved and current authorization through the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA) to enter the United States. However, the use of Form I-94W was discontinued after CBP began processing travelers using ESTA. If you are eligible for the Visa Waiver Program, CBP encourages you to apply for Form I-94 instead, through the
[official I-94 website](https://i94.cbp.dhs.gov/I94/#/home)
or the
[CBP One app](https://www.cbp.gov/about/mobile-apps-directory/cbpone)
.
