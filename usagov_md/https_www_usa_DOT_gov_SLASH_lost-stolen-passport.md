Lost or stolen passports
========================

If your passport is lost or stolen you must report it to the State Department right away. How you replace it depends on if you are inside or outside the U.S.

How to report your lost or stolen passport
------------------------------------------

* Online:
  [Use the online tool to submit Form DS-64 online.](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/have-passport/lost-stolen.html)
* By phone: Call toll-free 1-877-487-2778 (TTY 1-888-874-7793).
* By mail: Use
  [Form DS-64 [PDF, 3.6MB]](https://eforms.state.gov/Forms/ds64_pdf.pdf)
  and mail it to the address on the form.

Once you have reported your passport lost or stolen, the State Department invalidates it. You cannot use it if you find it.

**How to replace your lost or stolen passport**
-----------------------------------------------

### **Stolen or lost passport replacements inside the U.S.**

If you are in the U.S. and your passport is lost or stolen, you must use Form DS-11 to apply for a new passport in person.
[Follow the guidance from the State Department](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/have-passport/lost-stolen.html#replacelost)
, which is based on how quickly you need your new passport.
[Check current processing times](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/how-apply/processing-times.html)
to find out how long it will take.

### **Stolen or lost passport replacements outside the U.S.**

If you are outside the U.S., contact your nearest
[U.S. embassy or consulate](https://www.usembassy.gov/)
to replace your lost or stolen passport and find out how long the process will take. In some cases, you may be able to get a limited-validity passport if there is not enough time to get a regular passport.
