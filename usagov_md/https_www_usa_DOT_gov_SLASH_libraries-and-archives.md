Find libraries and archives
===========================

Local public libraries not only lend books. They help children learn to read, and adults learn English or find a job. Federal libraries gather and preserve special collections.

**Local public libraries**
--------------------------

Public libraries have:

* Experts who can help you find the resources you need
* Research databases
* Computer stations
* Books, movies, and music to borrow in print and digital formats
* English classes
* Programs and events for all ages based on holidays, historical events, and more
