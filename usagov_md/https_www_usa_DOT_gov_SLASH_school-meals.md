School meals and food programs for children
===========================================

Your child may qualify for free or reduced-price meals at their school or childcare center. They can get food assistance throughout the school year and during summer break.

What programs offer students meals during the school year?
----------------------------------------------------------

During the school year, your child can get free or reduced-price meals at school through:

* The
  [National School Lunch Program](https://www.fns.usda.gov/nslp/household)
* The
  [School Breakfast Program](https://www.fns.usda.gov/sbp/school-breakfast-program)
* The
  [Special Milk Program](https://www.fns.usda.gov/smp/special-milk-program)
  , which provides milk for students in schools that do not participate in a federal school meal program

Find out if your child is eligible for school meal programs
-----------------------------------------------------------

Your children may qualify for free school lunch, breakfast, or milk during the school year if:

* You meet household income guidelines
* You receive SNAP (food stamps), TANF (welfare), WIC, or the Food Distribution Program on Indian Reservations (FDPIR)
* They are foster children under the legal responsibility of a foster care agency or court
* They are enrolled in
  [Head Start](https://eclkc.ohs.acf.hhs.gov/)

Check with your child's school for specific eligibility requirements for your state.

How to apply for school meal programs
-------------------------------------

Ask your child's school for a meal program application. You can do this at the beginning of the school year or at any time if circumstances change.

Summer meal programs and benefits
---------------------------------

* The
  [Summer Food Service Program (SUN Meals)](https://www.fns.usda.gov/summer/sunmeals)
  offers one or more free meals during summer break. All children and teens 18 or younger qualify. There is no application process and no income limit.
  [Search for a summer meals site near you.](https://www.fns.usda.gov/summer/sitefinder)
* The SUN Bucks program gives eligible families in most states $120 per child during the summer to buy groceries. If you receive other benefits, such as SNAP or TANF, you may be automatically enrolled.
