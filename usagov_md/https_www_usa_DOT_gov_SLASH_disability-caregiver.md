Get paid as a caregiver for a family member
===========================================

Some government programs pay family or friends of people with disabilities to help with daily activities, including personal care, giving medicine, cooking, cleaning, and more.

**Become a paid caregiver through a state Medicaid program**
------------------------------------------------------------

If someone with a disability already receives Medicaid, their state may allow a family member or friend to become a paid caregiver.

Many states call this a consumer-directed personal assistance program. Each state has different requirements and rules. And the amount the program pays you to care for a family member varies by state.
[Contact your stateâs Medicaid office for more information.](https://www.medicaid.gov/about-us/where-can-people-get-help-medicaid-chip)

**Caring for a family member who is not eligible for Medicaid**
---------------------------------------------------------------

### **Long-term care insurance**

Some
[long-term care insurance policies](https://acl.gov/ltc/costs-and-who-pays/what-is-long-term-care-insurance)
allow family members to get paid as caregivers. Contact your insurance agent and ask for a written confirmation of benefits.

### **Paid family leave**

Some states require employers to offer family leave programs and some programs pay you to care for a family member. The eligibility requirements, the amount you will receive to provide care, and how long you can take off work varies by state. To learn more,
[contact your state labor office](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/state/contacts)
.

### **Local Area Agencies on Aging**

If your state does not offer a paid family leave program, an Area Agency on Aging (AAA) may be able to help with:

* Counseling and care referrals
* Day care programs for older adults
* Meal deliveries
* [Learn more about AAAs and search for resources in your area](https://eldercare.acl.gov/Public/About/Aging_Network/AAA.aspx)
  by entering your zip code or city and state.

**Veterans programs**
---------------------

There are three programs available for veterans:

* The
  [Veteran-Directed Home and Community-Based Services program](https://www.va.gov/GERIATRICS/pages/Veteran-Directed_Care.asp)
  offers veterans a flexible budget. With the help of a counselor, veterans may be able to hire a family member to help with daily living and activities.
* When a family caregiver is in place for a veteranâs home care, the Respite Care program can help with breaks for the caregiver, while still addressing the veteranâs care needs.
  [Learn more about Respite Care](https://www.va.gov/GERIATRICS/pages/Respite_Care.asp)
  to see if your caregiving situation is eligible.
* [Aid and Attendance Benefits program](https://www.va.gov/pension/aid-attendance-housebound/)
  provides monthly payments in addition to a monthly VA pension for qualified veterans and survivors. These benefits help cover the costs of a caregiver, who may be a family member.
  [Find the VA pension management center](https://www.va.gov/pension/pension-management-centers/)
  in your area to see if you qualify.
