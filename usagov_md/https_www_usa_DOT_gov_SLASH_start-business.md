How to start and fund your own business
=======================================

Learn how to start and manage your small business, and find local support if you need help.

**How to start a business**
---------------------------

If you want to start a new business, the Small Business Administration (SBA) can help.
[SBAâs 10-step guide](https://www.sba.gov/business-guide/10-steps-start-your-business)
explains how to plan, launch, and manage your business.

As you grow your business, itâs important to understand taxes, how to hire and manage employees, and your legal responsibilities.
[SBA's Business Guide](https://www.sba.gov/business-guide)
can help you manage day-to-day operations and prepare for success.

**Funding your small business**
-------------------------------

Businesses need money to start and grow. And they may need money to recover after a disaster. There are
[no federal grants for starting a business](https://www.usa.gov/no-free-money)
. But
[small business owners can get money](https://www.sba.gov/business-guide/plan-your-business/fund-your-business)
in different ways. This includes using personal funds, finding investors, or taking out loans.

The SBA also has funding for groups such as:

* [Women-owned businesses](https://www.sba.gov/business-guide/grow-your-business/women-owned-businesses)
* [Minority-owned businesses](https://www.sba.gov/business-guide/grow-your-business/minority-owned-businesses)
* [Native American-owned businesses](https://www.sba.gov/business-guide/grow-your-business/native-american-owned-businesses)
* [Veteran-owned businesses](https://www.sba.gov/business-guide/grow-your-business/veteran-owned-businesses)
* [Military spouse-owned businesses](https://www.sba.gov/business-guide/grow-your-business/military-spouse-businesses)

If you own a rural business, you can find support to start, expand, or maintain your farm or rural business. Resources include:

* [SBA financing options for rural businesses](https://www.sba.gov/business-guide/grow-your-business/rural-businesses)
* [Farm Service Agency loans](https://www.fsa.usda.gov/programs-and-services/farm-loan-programs/index)
  for farmers or ranchers

**Find local support**
----------------------

The SBA provides free or low-cost counseling and training. You can:

* Find support to learn new skills
* Connect with other business owners
* Apply for a loan for a declared disaster area
* Find help with government contracting, and more.

Contact SBA by:
