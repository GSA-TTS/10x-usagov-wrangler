How to get help with medical bills
==================================

Find out how you can get help with medical bills through free or low-cost medical care, government health insurance programs, or a medical debt management plan.

**Find help paying for medical care**
-------------------------------------

Government programs can help pay for medical care. Depending on the program, you may also be eligible for help with vision and dental care. Your income, age, employment status, and qualifying health issues will determine your eligibility. These programs include:

* Medicaid
* Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP)
* Medicare
* The Affordable Care Act (ACA) / Health Insurance Marketplace
* Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act (COBRA)

[Learn how these programs work, find out if you are eligible, and see how to apply.](/health-insurance)

### **More help with medical bills after insurance**

If you already receive coverage from Medicaid, Medicare, ACA Marketplace, or other insurance, additional programs may provide further support.

* Medicare Savings Programs - There are 4 Medicare Savings Programs that may be able to help with Part A and Part B premiums, deductibles, coinsurance, and copayments.
  [Learn more about the Medicare Savings Programs, if you qualify, and how to apply.](https://www.medicare.gov/basics/costs/help/medicare-savings-programs)
* Medicare Extra Help - This program can help you pay Medicare Part D costs that cover prescription drugs.
  [Find out if you qualify for Extra Help and apply.](https://www.medicare.gov/basics/costs/help/drug-costs)
* Charity care - If you still need help with medical bills after health insurance or Medicaid payments have been applied, a charity care program may assist you with the remaining costs. In most cases, you can apply for charity care through a doctor or hospital where you are seeking medical treatment.

**Get help paying for prescription drugs**
------------------------------------------

* [Contact the pharmaceutical companies that make your prescription drugs or devices.](https://www.medicare.gov/plan-compare/#/pharmaceutical-assistance-program?lang=en&year=2022)
  Ask them about low-cost options, samples, or discounts.
* [Learn about generic drugs](https://www.fda.gov/drugs/frequently-asked-questions-popular-topics/generic-drugs-questions-answers)
  and how they can lower your costs.
* [State social services agencies](/state-social-services)
  provide direct assistance to people with limited access to health care. They can offer referrals to local health centers and organizations that may be able to help.
* If you are eligible for Medicare, you can get help paying for your prescriptions through
  [Medicare Part D](https://www.medicare.gov/drug-coverage-part-d)
  .
* To get prescription coverage if you choose Medicare Part C, be sure to select a Medicare Advantage Plan that offers prescription drug coverage.
  [Learn more about Medicare Part C plans](https://www.medicare.gov/Pubs/pdf/12026-Understanding-Medicare-Advantage-Plans.pdf)
  beginning on page 12 of Understanding Medicare Advantage Plans.

**Find free or low-cost vaccines**
----------------------------------

Depending on your income, age, and health insurance coverage, you or your children may be eligible for free vaccinations.

* Use
  [Vaccines.gov](https://www.vaccines.gov/)
  to find free COVID-19 vaccinations near you.
* Learn about the
  [Vaccines for Children program (VFC)](https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines-for-children/about/index.html)
  for free childhood immunizations.
* Search for a
  [local health center](https://findahealthcenter.hrsa.gov/)
  that can give your family immunizations at a cost based on your income.

**Other programs offering free and low-cost medical care**
----------------------------------------------------------

Some government programs offer free or low-cost care for different health conditions, including:

* [National Breast and Cervical Cancer Early Detection Program (NBCCEDP)](https://www.cdc.gov/breast-cervical-cancer-screening/about/screenings.html)
  - Get free or low-cost breast and cervical cancer screenings. Eligibility for NBCCEDP is based on income, age, and whether you are uninsured or your insurance does not cover screenings.
* [Ryan White HIV/AIDS Program](https://ryanwhite.hrsa.gov/hiv-care/services)
  - Find help in your state or local area with HIV/AIDS medications and treatments. You may qualify for this program based on your income. And you must be uninsured, or the treatments and medications you need are not covered by your current insurance plan.

**Get help paying medical bills through debt management**
---------------------------------------------------------

In some cases, you may be able to get help paying your medical bills with a debt management plan. This involves a payment schedule that a credit counselor develops based on your situation. When you make a payment, your money is deposited into an account with the credit counseling organization, which then pays your debt. You may be able to get lower interest rates and certain fees waived to help make it easier to pay off your medical debt.
