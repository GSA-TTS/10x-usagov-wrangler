Child and dependent care tax credit
===================================

If you paid for your childâs or a dependentâs care while you worked or looked for a job, you may be eligible for a credit on your tax return.

Your eligibility to claim the child and dependent care credit will depend on the amount you paid to care for a qualifying child, spouse, or other dependent.
