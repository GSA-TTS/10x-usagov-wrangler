Food assistance programs for older adults
=========================================

If you are 60 or older, you may be eligible for food assistance, depending on your income. Learn about food assistance programs for seniors and how to apply.

**Learn what food assistance is available for older adults and if you are eligible**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### **Get food assistance through government benefits**

The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) offers food assistance for older adults who have a low income. These programs include:

* [Senior Farmers Market Nutrition Program (SFMNP)](https://www.fns.usda.gov/sfmnp/senior-farmers-market-nutrition-program)
  - Provides coupons for fresh fruits, vegetables, honey, and herbs. You can use the coupons at farmers markets, roadside stands, and community farms.
* [Commodity Supplemental Food Program (CSFP)](https://www.fns.usda.gov/csfp/applicant-recipient)
  - Provides a monthly package of healthy food. USDA distributes food to local agencies where you can pick it up. In some states, you may be eligible to have your food delivered.

SFMNP and CSFP are not available in every state. If your state participates in one or both programs,Â you may be eligible if you are:

* 60 or older
* Have an income at or below 185% of the
  [federal poverty income guidelines](https://aspe.hhs.gov/topics/poverty-economic-mobility/poverty-guidelines)

[Use these search filters to find and contact your state SFMNP and CSFP programs.](https://www.fns.usda.gov/fns-contacts)

If neither program is on your state's list, you may be eligible to get food stamps through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP).

### **Get food assistance through Medicare**

If you have insurance through Medicare Advantage (Part C), you may be eligible for a Medicare flex card. This card is a benefit offered by some insurers and is not issued by the government. It acts as a food allowance card for seniors, and can also help pay for utilities, transportation to medical appointments, and more. Not all Medicare Advantage insurance plans offer flex cards.

And if you currently have Medicare Advantage, contact your insurance provider to find out if they issue Medicare flex cards.
