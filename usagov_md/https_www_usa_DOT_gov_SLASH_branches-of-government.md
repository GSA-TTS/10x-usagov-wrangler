Branches of the U.S. government
===============================

Learn about the executive, legislative, and judicial branches of the U.S. government.

The Constitution of the United States divides the federal government into three branches: legislative, executive, and judicial. This ensures that no individual or group will have too much power.

Legislative branch
------------------

This branch is made up of
[Congress](https://www.congress.gov/members)
(the Senate and House of Representatives) and special agencies and offices that provide support services to Congress.

The legislative branchâs roles include:

* Drafting proposed laws
* Confirming or rejecting presidential nominations for heads of federal agencies, federal judges, and the Supreme Court
* Having the authority to declare war

Executive branch
----------------

The executive branchâs key roles include:

* President - The president is the head of state, leader of the federal government, and Commander in Chief of the United States armed forces.
* Vice president - The vice president supports the president. If the president is unable to serve, the vice president becomes president. The vice president also presides over the U.S. Senate and breaks ties in Senate votes.
* The Cabinet - Cabinet members serve as advisors to the president. They include the vice president, heads of executive departments, and other high-ranking government officials. Cabinet members are nominated by the president and must be approved by the Senate.

The executive branch also includes executive departments, independent agencies, and other boards, commissions, and committees.

Judicial branch
---------------

The judicial branch includes the
[Supreme Court](https://www.supremecourt.gov/about/justices.aspx)
and other federal courts.

It evaluates laws by:

* Interpreting the meaning of laws
* Applying laws to individual cases
* Deciding if laws violate the Constitution

How each branch of government provides checks and balances
----------------------------------------------------------

The ability of each branch to respond to the actions of the other branches is
[the system of checks and balances](https://bensguide.gpo.gov/j-check-balance)
.

Each branch of government can change acts of the other branches:

* The president can veto legislation created by Congress. He or she also nominates heads of federal agencies and high court appointees.
* Congress confirms or rejects the president's nominees. It can also remove the president from office in exceptional circumstances.
* The Justices of the Supreme Court, nominated by the president and confirmed by the Senate, can overturn unconstitutional laws.
