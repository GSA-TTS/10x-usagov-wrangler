International driverâs license for U.S. citizens
==================================================

If you are a U.S. citizen planning to drive while traveling abroad, find out if you need an International Driving Permit (IDP) for the country you are visiting.

**Know what an International Driving Permit (IDP) is and if you need one**
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

An International Driving Permit (IDP), sometimes known as an international driverâs license, allows you to drive legally in countries that require one. It is a document that translates your identifying information into different languages. If the country you are visiting requires an IDP, you will carry it along with your U.S. driverâs license.

When visiting another country as a U.S. citizen:

* Your state driver's license is valid while driving in Canada and Mexico.
* In other countries, you may need to get an IDP for foreign drivers.

Use the Department of State's website to
[search for the country you will be visiting](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages.html)
. On that countryâs page, see the "travel and transportation" section. It will explain your destinationâs driverâs license rules for visitors.

If you are not a U.S. citizen and are traveling to the United States,

**How to get an International Driving Permit**
----------------------------------------------

The American Automobile Association (AAA) is the official organization authorized by the U.S. Department of State to issue IDPs. Be aware of other websites that claim to issue international driverâs licenses or IDPs. Many are fraudulent and may try to scam you out of money or personal information.

If you have a U.S. driver's license,
