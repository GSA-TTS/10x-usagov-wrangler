Register for Selective Service (the draft)
==========================================

The Selective Service program requires eligible men to sign up for military service.

Military service in the U.S. is voluntary. But most young men must register with Selective Service. Learn about the registration process.

**Register with Selective Service**
-----------------------------------

[Register for Selective Service](https://www.sss.gov/register/)

You can register for Selective Service online or by mail.
[Print the registration form [PDF, 1.7MB].](https://www.sss.gov/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Form-1-Resized.pdf)
Fill it out and mail it to the address on the form.

**Who must register for Selective Service**
-------------------------------------------

Almost all men who are 18-25 years old and live in the United States must register for Selective Service. This includes:

* U.S. citizens (U.S. born, dual citizens, and naturalized)
* Immigrants (legal permanent residents and undocumented immigrants)
* Refugees and asylum seekers
* People with disabilities

Additionally, almost all men who are 18-25 year old U.S. citizens who live outside of the United States must also register for Selective Service.

See Selective Serviceâs full list of
[who is required and exempt from registering](https://www.sss.gov/register/who-needs-to-register/)
.

**Penalties for not registering**
---------------------------------

There are
[consequences if you fail to register](https://www.sss.gov/register/benefits-and-penalties/)
with Selective Service. It is a federal felony, punishable by fines or a prison sentence. And you may not be eligible for federal jobs, citizenship, or state-funded student financial aid.

**Getting called for duty**
---------------------------

The United States has not had a draft since 1973. Congress and the president would have to authorize a draft. In the case of a national emergency, the Selective Service will follow this
