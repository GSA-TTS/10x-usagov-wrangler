Warning
-------

[Processing times](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/how-apply/processing-times.html)
change throughout the year.

Children under 16
-----------------

All children under 16 must appear in person to apply. A parent (preferably both) must be present and must sign the passport application.

[Follow the step-by-step process for children under 16](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/need-passport/under-16.html)
from the State Department to:

* Get a child passport application form
* Learn what documents to submit that provide proof of U.S. citizenship and your relationship to your child
* Find out what to do if both parents and guardians cannot apply
* Calculate fees

Passports for children ages 16 and under are valid for 5 years.
**You cannot renew your child's passport.**
If your child is under 16 and their passport has expired or will expire soon, you must submit a new application in person.

Children ages 16-17
-------------------

Children ages 16-17 can apply for passports alone if they have their identification documents. A parent will need to either:

* Provide a signed statement saying they are aware the child is seeking a passport or
* Attend the passport appointment with them

[Follow the step-by-step process from the State Department](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/need-passport/16-17.html)
to:

* Get a child passport application form
* Learn what documents to submit that provide proof of U.S. citizenship and consent from one parent or guardian
* Calculate fees

Passports issued to children ages 16-17 are valid for 10 years.
**Your child cannot renew their passport if it was issued before they turned 16.**
Instead, they would need to submit an application in person for a new passport.

If you need your childâs passport quickly
-------------------------------------------

Depending on when and why your child is traveling, you may need to
[use the expedited process](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/get-fast.html)
. The time it takes varies throughout the year, and there may be additional fees.
[Use the fee calculator or chart](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/how-apply/fees.html)
.

Check the status of your child's passport application
-----------------------------------------------------

Follow the steps from the Department of State to
[check the status of your child's passport application or renewal online](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/need-passport/status.html)
.

Children in custody disputes
----------------------------

If you are concerned your child may be taken abroad by the other parent without your knowledge, you can enroll them in the
[Childrenâs Passport Issuance Alert Program (CPIAP)](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/International-Parental-Child-Abduction/prevention/passport-issuance-alert-program.html)
.

If you and your child are outside the U.S.
------------------------------------------

[Contact the U.S. embassy or consulate](https://www.usembassy.gov/)
near you to
[request a passport while outside the U.S.](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/need-passport/outside-us.html)

Be aware of passport expiration rules for your destination

Some countries and airlines will not allow a U.S. passport holder to enter if their passport expires in less than 6 months.

Check your destination country's U.S. passport expiration rules on the
[Department of State's country information page](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/International-Travel-Country-Information-Pages.html)
.

* On the left, search for the country name in the "learn about your destination" box.
* On that country's page, look for "passport validity."
