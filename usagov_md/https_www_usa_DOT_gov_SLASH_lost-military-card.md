How to report a lost or stolen military or veteran ID card
==========================================================

Where you report your lost or stolen military or veteran ID card depends on the type of card. Learn how and where to report your missing card.

**Report a lost or stolen military or veteran ID**
--------------------------------------------------

### Common Access Card (CAC)

Active-duty service members and civilian Department of Defense employees must report a lost or stolen Common Access Card (CAC) to their command or local security office.

### Uniformed Services ID (USID) card

USID cards are typically used by retired military members, reservists, and military dependents. Use the
[RAPIDS self-service ID office online](https://idco.dmdc.osd.mil/idco/#/)
to report a lost or stolen ID.

If you are a dependent, you will also need to complete a
[Form DD 1172-2](https://home.army.mil/natick/application/files/4115/5258/1275/dd1172-2.pdf)
. Submit this form to the ID office when you request a replacement card.

### Veteran ID Card (VIC)

Email
[vetidcard@va.gov](mailto:vetidcard@va.gov)
to report your VIC as lost or stolen.

### Veteran Health ID Card (VHIC)

Report a missing VHIC to the
[local VA medical center](https://www.va.gov/find-locations/)
where you got the card.
