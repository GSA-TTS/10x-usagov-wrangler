Prove your citizenship: born outside the U.S. to a U.S. citizen parent
======================================================================

Learn how to prove your U.S. citizenship if you were born without documentation outside the U.S. to a parent who was a U.S. citizen.

Typically, when a child is born outside the U.S. to parents who are U.S. citizens, they would file a Consular Report of Birth Abroad (CRBA). The U.S. Department of State issues CRBAs before a child turns 18 and are proof of the child's U.S. citizenship.
[Learn more about CRBAs](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/while-abroad/birth-abroad.html)
, including how to apply for one or get it replaced or corrected.

If your parents did not apply for a CRBA, you have two options for getting your citizenship recognized:

1. [Applying for a U.S. passport](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/need-passport/apply-in-person.html)
   - if your parent did not register your birth at a U.S. embassy or consulate, you will need:
   * Your foreign birth record showing your parents' names
   * Evidence of a parentâs U.S. citizenship
   * Your parents' marriage certificate, if applicable
   * A statement from your U.S. citizen parent(s) which lists where and when they lived in the U.S. and abroad before your birth
2. Applying for a Certificate of Citizenship - Submit Form N-600 to get a Certificate of Citizenship. This document serves as proof that you are a U.S. citizen.
