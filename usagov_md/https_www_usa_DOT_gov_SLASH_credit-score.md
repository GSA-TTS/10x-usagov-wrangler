Understand, get, and improve your credit score
==============================================

Learn how to get your credit score, how it is calculated, and what you can do to improve it.

What is a credit score?
-----------------------

A credit score is a number that creditors use to determine your credit behavior, including how likely you are to make payments on a loan.

Having a high credit score can make it easier to get a loan, rent an apartment, or lower your insurance rate. Learn how to get your credit score, how it is calculated, and what you can do to improve it.

**How to get your credit score**
--------------------------------

There are four main ways to get your credit score:

* Check your credit or loan statements.
* Talk to a credit or housing counselor.
* Find a credit score service.
* Buy your score from one of the three major credit reporting agencies: Equifax, Experian, or TransUnion.

[Learn more from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) about each method of obtaining your credit score.](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/where-can-i-get-my-credit-score-en-316/)

**How your credit score is calculated**
---------------------------------------

The three major credit reporting agencies create credit reports which include a history of your credit, loans, and other financial information. These credit reports are used to calculate your credit score.

The information from your credit report that affects your score includes:

* Payment history
* Outstanding balances
* Length of credit history
* Applications for new credit accounts
* Types of credit accounts (mortgages, car loans, credit cards)

**Ways to improve your credit score**
-------------------------------------

Your credit history directly affects your credit score. If you want to improve your score, there are some things you can do, including:

* Paying your loans on time
* Not getting too close to your credit limit
* Having a long credit history
* Making sure your credit report doesnât have errors
