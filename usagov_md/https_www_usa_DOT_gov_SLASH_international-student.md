Learn how to become an international student in the U.S.
========================================================

If you want to come to the U.S. to attend college but do not know the process, a 5-step guide from the Department of State can help.

Whether you want to spend just a semester or earn your whole degree in the U.S., use
[Your 5 Steps to U.S. Study](https://educationusa.state.gov/your-5-steps-us-study)
from the Department of State. It explains how you can:

* Research schools that meet your needs
* Pay your own tuition and expenses. While the U.S. government generally does not provide funding for international students to come to the U.S. to study,
  [you may qualify for student aid as a non-citizen through the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)](https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/eligibility/requirements/non-us-citizens)
  .
* Apply to a school
* Get a student visa
* Prepare to travel to the U.S. and your school
