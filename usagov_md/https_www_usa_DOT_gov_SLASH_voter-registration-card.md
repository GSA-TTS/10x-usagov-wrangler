How to get a voter registration card
====================================

A voter registration card confirms that you are registered to vote, but you do not need to bring it with you to vote. Find out how to get or replace your card.

**How to replace your voter registration card**
-----------------------------------------------

If your voter registration card was lost, damaged, or stolen, you can replace it by contacting your
[state or local election office](/state-election-office)
.

**Register or change your registration to get a voter registration card**
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

[When you register to vote](https://vote.gov/)
or
[change your registration](/change-voter-registration)
, you will be mailed a voter registration card. Your voter registration card typically includes your:

* Name
* Home address
* The address of the polling station where you will vote
* Your party affiliation if you listed one on your registration

**How long it takes to get a voter registration card**
------------------------------------------------------

After you register, it may take a few weeks to get your new voter registration card in the mail. Your state's election office will let you know if there is a problem with your registration.

### **If your voter registration card was lost in the mail**

If you do not receive your new voter registration card, check with your
[state or local election office](https://www.usa.gov/state-election-office)
.

### **Can you print your voter registration online?**

In some states you may be able to bring an electronic or printed copy of your voter registration when you go to the polling station to vote. Contact
[your state or local election office](https://www.usa.gov/state-election-office)
to find out if they accept copies as a valid form of voter ID and what other forms of ID they accept.

**What form of ID do you need to vote on Election Day?**
--------------------------------------------------------

If you are a registered voter, you will not need your voter registration card on Election Day. But you may need other identification since some states require a photo ID to vote.
