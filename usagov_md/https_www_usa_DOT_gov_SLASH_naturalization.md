Become a U.S. citizen through naturalization
============================================

Naturalization is the process of voluntarily becoming a United States citizen. Learn about the steps that lead to U.S. citizenship, including the naturalization test.

**What are the requirements for U.S. citizenship?**
---------------------------------------------------

To be eligible for U.S. citizenship, you must meet certain eligibility requirements. These include being:

* At least 18 years old when you apply
* Able to read, write, and speak basic English (depending on age)
* Of good moral character

You must also be in one of these categories:

* [Lawful permanent resident (Green Card holder) of five years](https://www.uscis.gov/citizenship/learn-about-citizenship/citizenship-and-naturalization/i-am-a-lawful-permanent-resident-of-5-years)
* [Married to a U.S. citizen and lawful permanent resident for three years](https://www.uscis.gov/citizenship/learn-about-citizenship/citizenship-and-naturalization/i-am-married-to-a-us-citizen)
* [U.S. military service member (active duty or veteran)](https://www.uscis.gov/military/naturalization-through-military-service)
* [Child of a U.S. citizen](https://www.uscis.gov/citizenship/learn-about-citizenship/i-am-the-child-of-a-us-citizen)

**How to apply for U.S. citizenship**
-------------------------------------

Follow the
[10-step naturalization process](https://www.uscis.gov/citizenship/learn-about-citizenship/10-steps-to-naturalization)
from the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). You will learn:

* If you are eligible for naturalization
* How to fill out Form N-400 to apply for naturalization
* What to do before taking the oath of citizenship

### How long does the naturalization process take?

Once you submit Form N-400, the amount of time it takes to become a naturalized U.S. citizen can depend on your location. You can
[check your case's estimated processing time](https://egov.uscis.gov/processing-times/)
by selecting the:

* Form you submitted (Form N-400 if you are applying for naturalization)
* Form category
* Field office or service center that is processing your case

**Prepare for your interview and citizenship test**
---------------------------------------------------

[This video shows you what takes place during a naturalization interview](https://www.uscis.gov/citizenship/learn-about-citizenship/the-naturalization-interview-and-test)
and helps you prepare for it.

For most people, one of the requirements during the interview is taking the 2008 U.S. naturalization test. The test has two parts: a civics test (U.S. history and government) and an English test.
