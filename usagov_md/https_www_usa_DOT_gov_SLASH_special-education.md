Early intervention and special education services for children
==============================================================

Learn how to get your child evaluated for early intervention and special education services to help with their development and learning.

**Early intervention services**
-------------------------------

Early intervention programs can provide support and services for infants and toddlers with developmental delays and disabilities. These services will depend on the needs of your child. They can include speech therapy, physical therapy, and more. Every U.S. state and territory offers early intervention services.

* For children from birth to 3 years old -
  [contact your stateâs early intervention service](https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/actearly/parents/states.html)
  for information on how to receive services.
* For children 3 years or older - contact your local elementary school or school district to request an evaluation. Your child can be evaluated even if they do not attend public school.

**Special education services**
------------------------------

Special education services are designed to meet the needs of students with disabilities. When students qualify for special education, they receive an Individualized Education Program (IEP). The IEP plans out instruction and resources to best support each child. These resources are available at no cost to families.

* If you have concerns about your childâs development, you can request an evaluation through your local school district. Your child can be evaluated even if they do not attend public school.

**Where else to get help**
--------------------------

* You may be able to find additional educational support services in your state through Parent Training and Information Centers (PTIs). They provide information and services for children and young adults from birth to age 26 and their families.
