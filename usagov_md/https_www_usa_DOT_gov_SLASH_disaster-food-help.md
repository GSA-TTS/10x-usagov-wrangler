D-SNAP disaster food relief
===========================

D-SNAP is a program that provides short-term funds for food if you are in a presidentially declared disaster area. Find out if you are eligible and how to apply.

**What is D-SNAP?**
-------------------

The Disaster Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (D-SNAP), also known as disaster food stamps, helps you pay for food if you live in a state with an Individual Assistance declaration from the president. D-SNAP provides funds on an electronic benefits transfer (EBT) card to pay for food.

Even if you do not normally receive or qualify for food assistance through SNAP benefits, you may qualify for D-SNAP.

D-SNAP eligibility for people who do not receive regular SNAP benefits
----------------------------------------------------------------------

You can receive D-SNAP if you live in a disaster area and you are facing:

* A loss of income because of the disaster
* Costly expenses because of the disaster
* Evacuation or relocation expenses
* A personal injury related to the disaster

D-SNAP eligibility for people who receive SNAP benefits
-------------------------------------------------------

If you receive SNAP benefits, you may still qualify for an additional amount. To get an increase in your benefits, you must:

* Receive less than the maximum amount for your family
* Have experienced a loss due to a disaster

The D-SNAP amount will increase your benefit to meet the maximum benefit for your family.

**How to apply for D-SNAP**
---------------------------

Each state sets its own process to apply for D-SNAP benefits. Contact your stateâs SNAP office to learn how to apply.
