Where to file a complaint about a mortgage company
==================================================

Find out where to complain about a mortgage company for discrimination, deceptive practices, and scams.

**Report a mortgage lender for discrimination**
-----------------------------------------------

If you think you have experienced housing discrimination, submit a
[housing complaint with the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/fair_housing_equal_opp/online-complaint)
.

Housing discrimination happens when a lending institution gets in the way of a person buying housing because of their:

* Race or color
* National origin
* Religion
* Sex
* Familial status (such as having children)
* Disability

The Fair Housing Act makes housing discrimination illegal.
