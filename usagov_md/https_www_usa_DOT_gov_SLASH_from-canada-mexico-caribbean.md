To strengthen U.S. border security, the WHTI sets standards for proving identity and citizenship when crossing U.S. borders. These standards determine what travel documents U.S. and non-U.S. citizens need to enter the U.S. from Canada, Mexico, the Caribbean, and Bermuda. Travelers who enter from Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and other U.S. territories are
**not**
affected by WHTI standards.
