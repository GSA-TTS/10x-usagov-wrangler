==========================================================

Apostilles and authentication certificates are both ways of certifying that U.S. documents are genuine and can be legally recognized in another country. Learn when to use each.

**What documents do authentication certificates and apostilles certify?**
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

Apostilles and authentication certificates verify signatures, stamps, or seals on important documents. These documents can include court orders, contracts, vital records, educational diplomas, and more.

The country you will use the document in determines whether you will need an apostille or an authentication certificate.

**How to get an apostille and when you need one**
-------------------------------------------------

If the country where you want to use your document
**is**
on the
[1961 Hague Convention member list](https://www.hcch.net/en/states/hcch-members)
, you will need an apostille.

* Documents such as vital records issued by a U.S. state will need an apostille from that state's secretary of state.
* Federal documents will need an apostille from the U.S. Department of State.

[Use this list to find the contact information to get an apostille](https://www.hcch.net/en/states/authorities/details3/?aid=353)
from the U.S. Department of State or your state's secretary of state.
