Navigating health, benefits, and living as a seniorÂ
====================================================

As we age, tasks can become harder, while situations change more rapidly. Asking for help becomes more commonplace, but sometimes you donât know where to start. No matter which stage of independence youâre in as a senior, explore the government resources that are available to help add ease to this phase of life.

Understand how the Administration for Community Living helps seniors
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The
[Administration for Community Living](https://acl.gov/)
was created to help older adults and those with disabilities live and thrive in the communities of their choosing.

* [LongTermCare.gov](https://acl.gov/ltc)
  helps many people prepare for life in their older years. Get informed on what insurance will or will not cover and help prepare for needs or expenses you may not be aware of.
* [Use the Eldercare Locator](https://eldercare.acl.gov/Public/Index.aspx)
  tool to find public services in your community to assist in areas like:
  + Support services like getting help from a caregiver
  + Housing for older adults
  + Elder rights when it comes to abuse and legal matters
  + Transportation for older adults to help maintain independence

Get active for your health and community
----------------------------------------

Activity as a senior is just as important as activity in any other age group, so be sure to
[get exercise in your regimen daily](https://www.nia.nih.gov/health/exercise-and-physical-activity/how-older-adults-can-get-started-exercise)
. Beyond physical exercise, there are other ways to stay active in your community.

* [Become an AmeriCorps Seniors volunteer](https://americorps.gov/serve/americorps-seniors)
  . This program is open to individuals 55 and older. You can choose from many different organizations to be a part of to service your community while gaining new skills and building valuable relationships.
* If youâre interested in working, the
  [Senior Community Service Employment Program (SCSEP)](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/seniors)
  is a joint community service and work-based job training program for older Americans. Participants in this program gain a wide variety of experience in many different public and private facilities like hospitals, schools and senior centers. Participants must meet qualifications to enroll.
