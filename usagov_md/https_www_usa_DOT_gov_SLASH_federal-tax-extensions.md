Federal tax return extensions
=============================

A tax return extension gives you six more months to file, but you must still pay your taxes on time. Learn about tax return extensions or how to pay your tax bill in installments.

How to file for a tax extension
-------------------------------

While you will get more time to file your return, an extension does not grant you more time to pay your taxes. To avoid possible penalties, you should estimate and pay your federal taxes by the due date.

[You can request an extension:](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/extension-of-time-to-file-your-tax-return)

* Online using
  [IRS Free File](https://www.irs.gov/filing/irs-free-file-do-your-taxes-for-free)

  [pay your estimated tax bill](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/estimated-taxes)
* Using
  [IRS Form 4868](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-4868)

How to pay taxes in installments
--------------------------------

If you feel that you may not be able to pay your tax bill in full by the due date, you may be eligible to pay in installments.
