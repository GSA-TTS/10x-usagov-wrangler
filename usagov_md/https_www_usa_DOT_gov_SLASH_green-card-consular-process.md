How to get a Green Card from outside the U.S.

To live and work in the U.S. permanently, you will need a Permanent Resident Card (Green Card). Learn how to get one through consular processing if you are outside the U.S.

Your eligibility to get a Green Card depends on many factors. These include your employment plans and the citizenship status of a family member who would sponsor you.

1. Visit the USCIS.gov website and
   [learn about Green Card eligibility categories](https://www.uscis.gov/green-card/green-card-eligibility-categories)
   to see if you qualify.
2. Select the category that applies to you.
3. Expand the selected category that matches your situation under "you may be eligible to apply as aâ¦" for eligibility and how to apply.

**Apply for a Green Card through consular processing**

Apply for a Green Card from outside the U.S. through a U.S. Department of State consulate. This procedure is known as consular processing.

[Learn how consular processing works](https://www.uscis.gov/green-card/green-card-processes-and-procedures/consular-processing)
, including:

* Determining what Green Card category you might be eligible for
