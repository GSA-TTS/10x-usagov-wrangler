How to get an export license or permit
======================================

Most items exported to a foreign buyer will not need an export license or permit. But all items are subject to export control laws and regulations.

**How to know if you need an export license**
---------------------------------------------

Only 5 percent of U.S. exports require an export license. Whether you need one depends on your product, the buyer, and the destination. To find out whether your product will need a license:
