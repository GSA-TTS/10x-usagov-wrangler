**What documents do you need to register to vote?**

In most cases, you will need either a driverâs license or a state ID to register to vote. If you do not have either of these, you may be able to provide other types of documentation, including a bank statement or utility bill. But the required documents you need to register vary by state.
[Check with your stateâs election office to find out what documentation they accept.](/state-election-office)
