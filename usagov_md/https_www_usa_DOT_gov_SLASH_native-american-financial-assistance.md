Financial assistance and services for Native Americans
======================================================

Federally recognized tribes can apply for government funding for services and programs. Some programs provide funds directly to tribal members living on or near reservations.

**Financial Assistance and Social Services (FASS)**
---------------------------------------------------

The Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) manages the
[Financial Assistance and Social Services (FASS)](https://www.bia.gov/bia/ois/dhs/financial-assistance)
program. It gives financial aid to tribal members who cannot get Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF), also known as welfare. Qualified members may receive money for:

* General needs such as food, clothing, shelter, and utilities
* Child care
* Emergencies, including homes destroyed by fire, flood, or other disasters
* Adult care, for in-home or residential care of Native Americans who are older or have a disability
* Burial costs of tribal members with a low income

[Look up and contact your BIA regional office](https://www.bia.gov/regional-offices?utm_source=benefitsgov&utm_medium=801page&utm_campaign=BIAFASA&utm_term=benefitsgov801&utm_content=BIAFASA1)
to learn how to apply for FASS benefits.
