Get help with energy bills
==========================

The LIHEAP and WAP programs help pay for heating, cooling, and home weatherization. Learn if you are eligible and how to apply. And get help if your utilities were disconnected.

**Find out if you are eligible for LIHEAP and apply**
-----------------------------------------------------

The Low Income Home Energy Assistance Program (LIHEAP) can help you pay your heating or cooling bills or get emergency services during an energy crisis. Depending on where you live, you may also qualify for help with electric bills.

Eligibility for LIHEAP is based on your income, and every state and territory has its own requirements. Answer a few questions to learn if you qualify, find your state or territoryâs LIHEAP office, and apply. In some cases, you may be able to submit your LIHEAP application online. Other LIHEAP offices may require you to apply in person.

**Find out if you are eligible for WAP and apply**
--------------------------------------------------

For home improvements that save money on energy, you may qualify for help through the Weatherization Assistance Program (WAP).

Your eligibility for weatherization assistance depends on your income. Or you may qualify if you already receive benefits through a federal assistance program such as Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) or Supplemental Security Income (SSI). To see if you are eligible and how to apply, contact your state's WAP office.

**Find out who to contact if your utilities are disconnected**
--------------------------------------------------------------

Each state has a different policy about when utility companies can and cannot disconnect your electricity or natural gas for non-payment. These policies may be based on:

* The current weather in your area
* Your age
* If you have a disability
* Which utility provider you have
