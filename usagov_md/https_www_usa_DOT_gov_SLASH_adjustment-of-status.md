Adjustment of status: Get a Green Card if you are in the United States
======================================================================

Adjustment of status allows a nonimmigrant visa holder to become a permanent U.S. resident with a Green Card. Learn if you are eligible, how to apply, and how much it costs.

**How adjustment of status works**
----------------------------------

If you are currently in the United States on a nonimmigrant visa, you may be able to stay and apply for adjustment of status. This will allow you to become a permanent resident and get a Green Card. Before you can apply for adjustment of status, you or someone else must file an immigration petition for you.
