Military and veteran retirement benefits
========================================

If you retire from a career in the military, you may be eligible for a pension. The plan and benefits you will receive depend on your situation.

**Pension plans for active duty military**
------------------------------------------

There are two pension plans for active duty service members. These include:

* The Legacy or High 36 Retirement System
* Blended Retirement System (BRS)

Both plans require 20 or more years of service. The amount you receive from each plan is also based on the amount you earned from your basic pay and the date you joined the military.

[Find your basic pay amount](https://www.dfas.mil/militarymembers/payentitlements/Pay-Tables/)
based on your pay grade and the number of years you served.

If you joined the military:

* Before January 1, 2006 - You are in the legacy/high 36 retirement system.
* Between Jan 1, 2006, and December 31, 2017 - You had a choice of keeping the legacy/high 36 or choosing the BRS.
* After December 31, 2017 - You are in the BRS.

### **Determine your military pension plan and calculate your pay**

[Legacy or High 36 Retirement System](https://militarypay.defense.gov/Pay/Retirement/)
- This plan is based on an average of your highest 36 months of basic pay. The government does not match your contributions to the Thrift Savings plan.

[Blended Retirement System (BRS)](https://militarypay.defense.gov/BlendedRetirement/)
- The government matches your contributions to the Thrift Savings Plan up to 4%. You will also receive a pension based on an average of your highest 36 months of basic pay.

**Retirement plans for reserve service members**
------------------------------------------------

Retiring reservists with an accumulation of 20 or more years of service typically begin receiving their retirement benefits at age 60. But you may still qualify if you are under 60 based on the time you spent in active duty.

Payments will not begin automatically. Request your retirement benefits from the department where you last served.

**Retirement benefits for service members with disabilities**
-------------------------------------------------------------

A service member who is at least 30% disabled may be eligible to get disability retirement benefits, also known as Chapter 61 retirement. Even if you served for fewer than 20 years, you may still qualify if you retired under the Temporary Early Retirement Act.

**Pension programs for veterans and survivors with a low income**
-----------------------------------------------------------------

* Served during a war
* Didn't have a dishonorable discharge
* Earn an income below a threshold
