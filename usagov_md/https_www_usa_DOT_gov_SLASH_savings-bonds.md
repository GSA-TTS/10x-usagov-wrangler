U.S. savings bonds
==================

Learn about the types of U.S. savings bonds, how to buy or redeem them, and calculate their value. Find out how to change a bondâs ownership, replace it, and whether it is taxable.

What are savings bonds?
-----------------------

By buying a U.S. savings bond, you are lending the government money. When you redeem a bond, the government pays you back the amount you bought the bond for plus interest.

Manage electronic savings bonds
-------------------------------

To buy, redeem, or manage electronic savings bonds, you will need to create or log into your
[TreasuryDirect account](https://www.treasurydirect.gov/log-in/)
.

Buy savings bonds
-----------------

You can buy electronic savings bonds online. Paper bonds can only be purchased as part of your IRS tax refund.
