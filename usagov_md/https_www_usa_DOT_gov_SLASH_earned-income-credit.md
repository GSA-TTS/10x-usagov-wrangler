Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)
===============================

If you have a low income, you may be able to claim the Earned Income Tax Credit to reduce the amount of taxes you owe and possibly increase your refund.

**Who is eligible for the Earned Income Tax Credit?**
-----------------------------------------------------

You may be eligible for the EITC if you have a low income. The amount of credit you get when you file your return can depend on whether you have children, dependents, or a disability. However, you may still be able to claim the EITC even if you do not have a qualifying child.

If you qualify for the EITC, you may be able to claim credit on returns from prior years. You have 3 years to file a claim after the date your tax return was due.
