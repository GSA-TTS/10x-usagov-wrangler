How to get an import license or permit
======================================

In most cases, you will not need a license to import goods into the U.S. But for some items, agencies may require a license, permit, or other certification.

U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) enforces import laws at U.S. ports of entry. CBPâs
[Tips for New Importers and Exporters](https://www.cbp.gov/trade/basic-import-export/importer-exporter-tips)
provides an overview.

**Find out if you need an import license or permit**
----------------------------------------------------

Check the requirements of the federal agency or agencies that regulate the product you plan to import.

* These
  [CBP import guidelines](https://www.cbp.gov/document/publications/importing-united-states)
  describe the types of items that may need a license or permit.
* Always check with the federal agency for the most up-to-date information.

**How to get an import license or permit**
------------------------------------------

Contact the agency that requires the license or permit.

* Each agency has its own application forms and procedures.
* Find agency contact information at the end of the
  [CBP import guidelines [PDF, 477KB]](https://www.cbp.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Importing%20into%20the%20U.S.pdf)
  .

**Contact the port of entry**
-----------------------------

Contact the
[port of entry](https://www.cbp.gov/contact/ports)
for your shipment to ask about import requirements and related information.

CBP recommends you speak with an import specialist at the
[CBP Centers of Excellence and Expertise](https://www.cbp.gov/trade/centers-excellence-and-expertise-information)
before you import.

**Find required entry forms**
-----------------------------

You must fill out
[CBP entry forms](https://www.dhs.gov/find-importexport-forms)
within 15 calendar days of your shipmentâs arrival at a U.S. port of entry. Make sure to provide your importer number on all these forms.

* Your importer number is your
  [IRS business registration number](https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/employer-id-numbers)
  . If you do not have this number or you do not own a business, you can use your Social Security number.
* You can also request a CBP-assigned number. Complete
  [CBP Form 5106](https://www.cbp.gov/document/forms/cbp-form-5106-createupdate-importer-identity-form)
  and bring it to the entry branch at a
  [CBP port of entry](https://www.cbp.gov/contact/ports#wcm-survey-target-id)
