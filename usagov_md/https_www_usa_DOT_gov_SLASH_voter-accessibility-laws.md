Voter accessibility laws
========================

Voter accessibility laws ensure that people with disabilities or language barriers are able to vote. Learn about the laws and the accommodations they provide.

**Who to contact about voter accommodations**
---------------------------------------------

If you know you will need accommodations to vote in person on Election Day, contact your
[state or local election office](/state-election-office)
. They can help you understand what to expect at your polling place.

**Laws and accommodations for voters with disabilities**
--------------------------------------------------------

Several federal laws protect the voting rights of Americans with disabilities. These include the
[Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)](https://www.ada.gov/ada_voting/ada_voting_ta.htm)
and the
[Help America Vote Act (HAVA)](https://www.eac.gov/about_the_eac/help_america_vote_act.aspx)
.

Voters with disabilities have the right to:

* Vote in private, without help
* Have an accessible polling place with voting machines for voters with disabilities

Polling places must have:

* Wheelchair-accessible voting booths
* Entrances and doorways at least 32 inches wide
* Handrails on all stairs
* Voting equipment for people who are blind or visually impaired

If you have a disability, you may:

* Seek help from poll workers trained to use an accessible voting machine, or
* Bring someone to help you vote

You can also ask your
[state or local election office](/state-election-office)
what other options you have.

* Some states offer âcurbside voting," when a poll worker brings everything you need to vote to your car.
* Local organizations may provide transportation to the polls.
* Many states let people with disabilities
  [vote absentee by mail](/absentee-voting)
  .

**Voting accessibility for voters needing language assistance**
---------------------------------------------------------------

The Election Assistance Commission (EAC) helps people overcome language barriers to voting.

* The downloadable
  [Voterâs Guide to Federal Elections](https://www.eac.gov/voters/voters-guide-to-federal-elections)
  is available in 11 languages. Find tips on everything from registering to vote to casting a ballot on Election Day.
* The
  [National Mail Voter Registration Form](https://www.eac.gov/voters/national-mail-voter-registration-form)
  is available in 21 languages. You can use it in most states to register and to update your voter registration information.

Federal law also lets anyone who cannot read or write bring someone to the polls to help.
