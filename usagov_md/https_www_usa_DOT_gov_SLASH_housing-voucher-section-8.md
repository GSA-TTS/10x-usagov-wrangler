Section 8 housing
=================

A Section 8 housing choice voucher can help you pay rent for private housing. Learn if you are eligible for a voucher and how to apply.

What are Section 8 housing choice vouchers?
-------------------------------------------

The Section 8 housing choice voucher program is provided by the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD). This program can offer you a voucher to help you afford safe, private housing. Section 8 vouchers are managed by your local public housing agency (PHA).

### How Section 8 housing vouchers work

Families with a low income, seniors, and people with disabilities may qualify to use Section 8 vouchers to find housing.

* You can choose any housing that meets the program requirements, such as a single-family home, townhouse, or apartment.
* Housing choice vouchers can pay for all or part of your rent.
* The PHA pays its part of the rent to the owner (landlord), and you as the tenant pay the difference.

**How to apply for Section 8 housing**
--------------------------------------

To apply for a Section 8 housing choice voucher:

* Contact your local public housing agency to apply for a housing choice voucher or check the status of your application.
* If you need help,
  [contact your local HUD office](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/field_policy_mgt/localoffices)
  .

Waiting lists and long waiting periods for vouchers are common because HUD and local PHAs have limited resources. A PHA may temporarily close its waiting list when it has more families on the list than it can help. Check back with your local PHAâs website to find out when its waiting list will reopen.
