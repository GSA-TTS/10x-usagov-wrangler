What programs and services are available for veterans?
======================================================

Members leave the military and return to civilian life every year. But life after the military can present many difficult and unique challenges.

If you are experiencing financial hardship or transition struggles, know there are resources that can help. Discover how you can get support with your career, bills, housing, and more.

**Looking for career help?**
----------------------------

[Get support for the career you want from the Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E) program](https://www.benefits.va.gov/vocrehab/)
. Explore services to help with job training, education, employment accommodations, and resume development. You may be able to start your own business, or get help as a veteran with a disability who canât work. Find out if you are eligible and how to apply for VR&E benefits.

**In search of housing?**
-------------------------

If you are experiencing homelessness, federal government benefit programs may be able to help you. VA programs connect homeless and at-risk veterans with housing options.
[Use VA.gov to find safe housing solutions](https://www.va.gov/HOMELESS/for_homeless_veterans.asp)
, like temporary housing or rental benefits.

**Looking for food assistance?**
--------------------------------

Ensure you, your family, and fellow veterans have nutritious meals in times of need.
[Explore the Department of Agricultureâs nutrition programs](https://www.fns.usda.gov/military-and-veteran-families)
and check which one you may qualify for.

**Exploring your health care options?**
---------------------------------------

Women veterans can access health services for all stages of your life. Women Veterans Health Care benefits provide coverage for personalized, comprehensive care, cancer screenings, maternity care, and more.
