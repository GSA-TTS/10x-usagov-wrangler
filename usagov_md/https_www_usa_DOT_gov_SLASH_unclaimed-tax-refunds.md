Undelivered and unclaimed tax refund checks
===========================================

Every year, millions of federal and state tax refunds go undelivered or unclaimed. Learn how to claim your refund if you did not file a return or if your check never got to you.

**Undelivered federal tax refunds**
-----------------------------------

### **If you never received your tax refund**

If you were expecting a federal tax refund and did not receive it, check the IRS
[Whereâs My Refund](https://www.irs.gov/refunds)
page. You will need to enter your Social Security number, filing status, and the exact whole dollar amount of your refund.

### If your tax refund check was lost or stolen

To replace a lost or stolen tax refund check, you can request a refund trace. The IRS uses refund traces to track lost or stolen checks or verify whether a check was deposited.
[Find out how to request a refund trace and replace your refund check.](https://www.irs.gov/faqs/irs-procedures/refund-inquiries/refund-inquiries-0)

### **If you cannot get your refund status after checking online**

You can also
[call the IRS](https://www.usa.gov/contact-irs)
to check on the status of your refund. Wait times to speak with a representative can be long. But you can avoid waiting by using the automated phone system. Follow the message prompts when you call.

### **If you moved after filing your return**

Refund checks are mailed to your last known address. If you move without notifying the IRS or the U.S. Postal Service (USPS), your refund check may be returned to the IRS. Submit a
[Change of Address Form 8822 [PDF, 81KB]](https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/f8822.pdf)
to the IRS. Also, submit a
[change of address to the USPS](https://moversguide.usps.com/mgo/disclaimer)
.

### **If you received a CP237A notice from the IRS**

[The IRS will send you a CP237A](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/understanding-your-cp237a-notice)
if the tax refund check they sent you was never deposited. If you received this notice, call 1-800-829-0115 to claim your refund. In most cases, you will get your refund within 30 days of contacting the IRS.

**You may be entitled to an unclaimed federal tax refund**
----------------------------------------------------------

If you are eligible for a federal tax refund but do not file a return, your refund will go unclaimed. Even if you are not required to file a return, it might benefit you to file if:

* Federal taxes were withheld from your pay, and/or
* You qualify for the
  [Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC)](https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/individuals/earned-income-tax-credit-eitc)

You may not have filed a tax return because your wages were below the filing requirement. But you can still file a return within three years of the filing deadline to get your refund.

**State tax refunds**
---------------------

For information about your state tax refund, contact
