Important
---------

The federal government does not offer âfree moneyâ to individuals to repair or improve their homes. Websites and ads claiming to offer âfree money from the governmentâ are often scams.

**Home repair programs for American Indians and Alaska Natives**
----------------------------------------------------------------

If you are an American Indian tribal member or Alaska Native with a very low income, you may qualify for help through the Housing Improvement Program (HIP).

* [Learn about eligibility and how to apply for HIP.](https://www.bia.gov/bia/ois/dhs/housing-program)

  , which can be used to pay for home repairs and improvements.
* [Disability housing grants](https://www.va.gov/housing-assistance/disability-housing-grants/)
