Find a U.S. embassy
===================

U.S. embassies act as headquarters for U.S. government representatives abroad. They help U.S. citizens and non-citizens with travel and immigration-related issues.

U.S. embassies are located in countries around the world. They can help U.S. citizens get help during an emergency, replace a passport, and more. Non-citizens can get help getting a visa to come to the United States.
