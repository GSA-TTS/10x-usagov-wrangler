Agencies to notify when someone dies
====================================

After someone dies, notify the government programs and businesses they used. Cancel benefits payments and close or transfer accounts.

Government agencies and programs to notify of a death
-----------------------------------------------------

Youâll need the personâs Social Security number and certified copies of their death certificate for most agencies and programs.

Social Security and Medicare
----------------------------

The funeral director should
[report the death to the Social Security Administration (SSA)](https://www.ssa.gov/personal-record/when-someone-dies)
for you. If they do not, you must do this as soon as possible.

* SSA will notify Medicare.
* Any Social Security benefits the person was receiving will stop.
* You must return any payment for the month the person died.
* You can ask about
  [Social Security survivors benefits](https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/survivors/ifyou.html)
  when you call.

Motor vehicles office
---------------------

Contact the
[state motor vehicles office](/state-motor-vehicle-services)
to:

* Cancel the personâs license or ID
* Transfer the title of a vehicle the person owned

Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
------------------------------

You must
[file the personâs final income tax return(s)](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/file-the-final-income-tax-returns-of-a-deceased-person)
. Include all unreported income the person earned up to their date of death.

U.S. passport
-------------

You can
[return the personâs passport](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/passports/have-passport/lost-stolen.html)
to the Department of State (DOS) for cancellation. (See âHow do I cancel the passport of a deceased relative?â for instructions.)

* This helps prevent identity theft.
* The DOS will send the canceled passport back if you want it or they can destroy it.

State social services benefits

Contact the
[state social services office](/state-social-services)
to cancel payments for benefit programs. These may include:

* SNAP (food stamps)
* TANF (welfare)

Voter registration
------------------

Contact the
[local election office](/state-election-office)

[Report a military retireeâs death](https://www.dfas.mil/RetiredMilitary/survivors/Retiree-Death/)

OPM will help process any annuity due to survivors.

Death of a U.S. citizen abroad
------------------------------

Notify the
[U.S. embassy or consulate](https://www.usembassy.gov/)
in the country where the person died. They can help you communicate with local authorities and help with arrangements and documents. Learn more about
[how embassies can help following an American citizen's death in a foreign country](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/international-travel/while-abroad/death-abroad1.html)
.

Financial institutions and other organizations to notify of a death
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Report the personâs death to banks, credit card companies, credit bureaus, and other financial organizations. And contact utilities and places where the person had memberships and subscriptions.
[Learn from the Federal Trade Commission what to do about any debts](https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/debts-deceased-relatives)
the person had.
