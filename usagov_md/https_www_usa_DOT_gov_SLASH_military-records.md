How to get copies of military records
=====================================

Getting access to military records can help with veterans benefits, ancestry research, and more. Learn how to get your own records or someone else's.

**Request service records**
---------------------------

### 1917 - present

#### Records for yourself or next of kin

You can request service records for yourself or for your next of kin (spouse, parent, child, or sibling). Choose one of three ways to request service records from the National Archives:

* [Start your records request online](https://www.archives.gov/veterans/military-service-records#evetrecs)
  for recent military service.
* [Print and fill out a Form SF 180 [PDF, 894KB].](https://www.archives.gov/files/research/order/standard-form-180.pdf)
  Mail it to the appropriate address on the form.
* Write a letter to request records,
  [following the directions and using the address under number 2 on this web page](https://www.archives.gov/veterans/military-service-records/standard-form-180.html)
  .

#### Records for someone not next of kin

You will need written consent from the veteran or their next of kin to access their full records. You can still access limited information about a veteran without their consent.
