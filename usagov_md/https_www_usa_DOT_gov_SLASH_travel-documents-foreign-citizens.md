Travel documents for foreign citizens returning to the U.S.
===========================================================

If you are a citizen of another country and have been living in the U.S., you may need special documents if you leave the U.S. and then return.

**Travel documents for permanent and conditional permanent residents**
----------------------------------------------------------------------

### If you are outside the U.S. for less than one year

If you are a permanent or conditional permanent resident who has been away from the U.S. for less than one year, you will only need to show your Green Card upon re-entry to the U.S.

### If you are outside the U.S. for one year or longer

If you are a permanent or conditional permanent resident who has been outside the U.S. for one year or longer, apply for a re-entry permit before you travel. Use
[Form I-131 - Application for Travel Document](https://www.uscis.gov/i-131)
.

* For permanent residents, the re-entry permit is valid for two years from the date of issue.
* For conditional permanent residents, the re-entry permit is valid for two years after the date of issue. Or it is valid up until the
  [date you must apply for removal of the conditions on your status](https://www.uscis.gov/green-card/after-we-grant-your-green-card/conditional-permanent-residence)
  , whichever date comes first.

If your re-entry permit has been lost or stolen, you may be able to re-enter the U.S. by applying for carrier documentation. Use
[Form I-131A - Application for Travel Document (Carrier Documentation)](https://www.uscis.gov/i-131a)
.

**Travel documents for other foreign citizens living in the U.S.**
------------------------------------------------------------------

If you are a foreign citizen re-entering the U.S., the documentation you need may depend on your immigration status:

* **Advance parole**
  - You may use advance parole to re-enter the U.S. without applying for a visa. It is commonly used for re-entry by people in the process of applying for permanent residence, applying for a status adjustment, or applying for asylum.
* **Refugee travel document**
  - You may be able to use this document to re-enter the U.S. if you have refugee or asylum status.

You must apply for advance parole or a refugee travel document before you leave the U.S. If you do not, you may not be allowed to return to the U.S. Use
[Form I-131 - Application for Travel Document](https://www.uscis.gov/i-131)
.
