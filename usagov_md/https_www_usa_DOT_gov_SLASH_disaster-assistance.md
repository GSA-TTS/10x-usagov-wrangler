How to apply for disaster assistance
====================================

Presidentially declared disasters are eligible for help from FEMA. If your area is not eligible, state agencies and other organizations may offer assistance. Learn how to apply.

**Who qualifies for FEMA disaster relief?**
-------------------------------------------

You must live in a presidentially declared disaster area to receive financial assistance from FEMA.
[Search for your area in the address lookup tool](https://www.disasterassistance.gov/get-assistance/address-lookup)
to find out if you are eligible.

Not everyone qualifies for all the assistance programs in an area. FEMA offers an anonymous tool to help you check your eligibility.

**Get tax relief after a disaster**
-----------------------------------

If you live in an area affected by a federally declared disaster, you may be eligible for IRS tax relief. Tax relief options may include a tax filing extension and an expedited refund.

**How to get legal help after a disaster**
------------------------------------------

Disaster Legal Services (DLS) provides free legal help to individuals who earn a low income and live in a federally declared disaster area. Legal advice is limited to cases that will not produce a fee. Cases that may generate a fee are turned over to a local lawyer referral service.

DLS may be able to help you with:

* Insurance claims for doctor and hospital bills, loss of property, or loss of life
* New wills, powers of attorney, and other legal documents lost in the disaster
* Home repair contracts and contractors
* Problems with landlords

**Find assistance if the disaster you experienced was not federally declared**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The president of the United States decides which natural disasters are federally declared. In many cases, this decision is based on whether state and local governments in the disaster area can provide enough assistance to disaster survivors.

If the disaster you experienced was not declared an emergency federally, you may be eligible for help from other resources:

* You may be able to get free shelter and food through the Red Cross if it is offering assistance near you.
  [Find out if the Red Cross serves your community](https://www.redcross.org/get-help/disaster-relief-and-recovery-services/find-an-open-shelter.html)
  and get tips on what to pack if you need help.
* State and local governments may assist disaster survivors by providing food and shelter.
  [Contact your stateâs social service agency](https://www.usa.gov/state-social-services)
  to find out what help you may qualify for.
