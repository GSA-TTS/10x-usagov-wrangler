International travel documents for children
===========================================

See what documents a child needs to travel to or from the U.S. alone or with a parent or relative.

Non-U.S. citizen children traveling to the U.S.
-----------------------------------------------

All children, including infants, must have their own travel documents, such as a passport or visa to enter the U.S.

Additionally, if the child is traveling alone, with only one of their custodial parents, or with a guardian to the U.S., they should have:

* Documents that their country requires for children traveling outside their country without both parents
  + Each country has its own rules for the specific documents it requires for a child to be allowed to leave their home country without both of their custodial parents or with a guardian. Contact
    [the embassy or consulate of the country the child is a citizen of](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/consularnotification/ConsularNotificationandAccess.html)
    to find out what specific documents the country requires to allow the child to leave their country.
* A letter of consent, preferably in English and notarized, from the other parent or signed by both custodial parents.
  + The letter should say: "I acknowledge that my child is traveling outside the country with [the name of the adult] with my permission."
  + A parent who frequently crosses the border by land with a minor should always carry a letter of permission from the other parent.
  + A parent with sole custody of the child they are traveling with should carry a copy of the custody document.

If your child is traveling alone by air, the airline may require you to submit an unaccompanied minor form and pay a fee for unaccompanied minor service. This service provides an airline employee escort for your child at the airport and on board the plane. In addition, you and the person picking your child up at their destination may also need to provide the airline with identification and contact information.

Contact your airline before your childâs trip to find out:

* What age requirements the airline has for their unaccompanied minor service
* If you can book a ticket with a connecting flight
* What documents and fees are required

U.S. citizen children traveling outside the U.S.
------------------------------------------------

Children traveling to most other countries are required to have a U.S. passport.

Depending on the country, the child may also need a visa and other travel documents.

### **Providing parental consent when a child travels without both custodial parents**

Ports of entry in many countries have security measures to prevent
[international child abduction](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/International-Parental-Child-Abduction.html)
. If your child is traveling alone or with only one parent or legal guardian, they may need a letter of consent from the other custodial parent.

* The letter of consent, preferably in English and notarized, from the other parent (if the child is traveling with one custodial parent) or signed by both parents (if the child is traveling with a guardian or alone) should say: "I acknowledge that my child is traveling outside the country with [the name of the adult] with my permission."

Additionally, if a minor is traveling abroad alone:

* [Contact the embassy or consulate of the country your child will be visiting](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/consularnotification/ConsularNotificationandAccess.html)
  and ask about entry and exit requirements for that country.

This service provides an airline employee escort for your child at the airport and on board the plane. In addition, you and the person picking your child up at their destination may also need to provide the airline with identification and contact information.
