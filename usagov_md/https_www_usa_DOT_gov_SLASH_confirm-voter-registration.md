How to confirm your voter registration status
=============================================

Check your voter registration online to confirm your voter registration number and if you are still registered. Verify your name, address, political party, and polling place.

**How to check if you are registered to vote**
----------------------------------------------

1. Visit
   [Can I Vote](https://www.nass.org/can-I-vote)
   and select "voter registration status."
2. Choose your state. You will be taken to a page on your state's election website.
3. Check to see if you are registered.

info

Important
---------

Check your registration information
**before**
your state's registration deadline to register to vote. That could be
**up to 30 days before the election**
. This gives you time if you need to re-register or make changes.

**Do you need to re-register or change your registration?**
-----------------------------------------------------------

**No**
, if:

* Your name and address have not changed, and you are an active voter.

**Yes**
, if:

* You have moved within your state or changed your name.
  [Update your voter registration](/change-voter-registration)
  with your new location or your new name. Make sure you also update your state driver's license or state ID card before the election, if that is the voter ID you will use.
* You have moved permanently to another state.
  [Register to vote in the new state](https://vote.gov/)
  .

**Maybe**
, if:

* You move to a different state very close to the date of a presidential primary or general election.
  + In some states, you may be able to register to vote when you cast your ballot on Election Day.
    [Find out if your state has same-day registration.](https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/same-day-voter-registration)
  + Some states, counties, and voting districts require you to be a resident for up to 30 days before an election.
    [Check the date of your next federal, state, or local election.](https://www.usvotefoundation.org/state-election-dates-and-deadlines)
  + If you do not have time to register in your new state before a presidential primary or general election, your old state must allow you to vote in person or by absentee ballot. After that, you will need to register in your new state and begin voting there.

**Why you should look up your voter registration information**
--------------------------------------------------------------

States try to keep their voter registration lists as accurate as possible. This means:

* Removing registrations of voters who are no longer residents
* Marking some registrations as inactive

You may be marked inactive if you:

* Do not respond to election officialsâ postcards or letters
  *and*
* Have not voted in the last two federal general elections (a midterm and a presidential election)

If your registration is inactive, you may have to take extra steps before you can vote. If you do not, you may have to cast a provisional ballot.

Checking and updating (as needed) your registration ahead of time ensures:

* Your name, address, and party affiliation are up-to-date. Depending on your state, you may not see your party affiliation listed when you check your registration. This is because some states do not require you to declare a party when you register.
* You have time to make any necessary changes if your registration is marked inactive.
* You can vote.
* You know your correct polling place.
