How to check and change your tax withholding
============================================

Withholding is the amount of income tax your employer pays on your behalf from your paycheck. Learn how to make sure the correct amount is being withheld and how to change it.

**Check your federal tax withholding**
--------------------------------------

The amount of tax withheld from your pay depends on what you earn each pay period. It also depends on what information you gave your employer on Form W-4 when you started working. This information, like your filing status, can affect the tax rate used to calculate your withholding. Contact your employer to get a copy of the W-4 you submitted and confirm what tax withholdings you requested.

Since the exact amount that is withheld from your pay can change with each paycheck, the easiest way to figure out your tax withholding is by estimating it.

[Visit the IRS Tax Withholding for Individuals](https://www.irs.gov/individuals/employees/tax-withholding)
page to:

* Know when to check your withholding
* Use the withholding estimator tool to estimate your tax withholding

**Decide how much tax to withhold**
-----------------------------------

The more taxes you withhold from your pay, the less you may owe when your tax bill is due. Knowing when to increase or decrease the amount of taxes withheld from your paycheck can depend on:

* How many jobs you have
* If you have income from outside your job that is not subject to withholding
* If you are eligible for income tax credits or deductions

* [Complete Form W-4P](https://www.irs.gov/forms-pubs/about-form-w-4-p)
