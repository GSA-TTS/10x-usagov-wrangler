File a complaint about a state or federal prison
================================================

You can file a complaint about a prison, policy, procedure, or abuse of someone in prison. Learn where to direct your complaint and what steps to take.

**Complain about a local, county, or state prison**
---------------------------------------------------

To submit a complaint about a local, county, or state prison:

1. File a formal complaint first directly with the correctional facility. Find it through the website for the
   [state department of corrections](/state-corrections)
   .
2. If the issue remains unsolved, complain to the
   [state department of corrections](/state-corrections)
   .
3. [Contact your governor](/state-governor)
   if the prison and the department of corrections still have not addressed your complaint.

Give the complaint time to progress before going on to the next step. You can also
[seek qualified legal advice](/legal-aid)
if your complaint remains unresolved.

**Complain about a federal prison**
-----------------------------------

To submit a complaint about a federal prison:

1. File a formal complaint directly with the facility.
   [Look up the prison contact information.](https://www.bop.gov/locations/)
2. If the prison did not resolve your complaint, file a complaint with the
   [Bureau of Prisons (BOP) regional office](https://www.bop.gov/about/facilities/offices.jsp)
   that oversees the facility.
3. If you still cannot get your issue addressed, contact
   [BOP Headquarters](https://www.bop.gov/contact/)
   or the
   [Department of Justice - Office of the Inspector General](https://oig.justice.gov/about/directory)
   , which oversees BOP.
