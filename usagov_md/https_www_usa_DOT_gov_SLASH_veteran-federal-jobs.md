Federal jobs for veterans

**Veterans' preference**
------------------------

As a veteran, you may get preference over other candidates when you apply for federal jobs. But a veterans' preference does not guarantee that you will get the job. And not every veteran is eligible.

[Learn about veteransâ preference in federal employment and the point system](https://www.opm.gov/fedshirevets/veteran-job-seekers/vets/)
awarded for military service or a service-connected disability.

**Contact veteran employment program offices by government agency**
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Many federal agencies have a veteran employment program office. These offices recruit, train, and assist with the hiring of veterans.
