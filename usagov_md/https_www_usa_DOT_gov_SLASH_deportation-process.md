Understand the deportation process
==================================

Learn how the deportation process works and how to get help if you are facing deportation.

Deportation is the process of removing a noncitizen from the U.S. for violating immigration law.

The U.S. may detain and deport noncitizens who:

* Participate in criminal acts
* Are a threat to public safety
* Violate their visa

What happens when someone is detained by immigration
----------------------------------------------------

The foreign national may be held in a detention center before trial or deportation.

.

After a noncitizen is detained, they may go before a judge in immigration court during the deportation (removal) process. In some cases, a noncitizen is subject to expedited removal without being able to attend a hearing in immigration court. Expedited removal may happen when a noncitizen:

* Comes to the U.S. without proper travel documents
* Uses forged travel documents
* Does not comply with their visa or other entry document requirements

.

Immigration court hearings and rulings
--------------------------------------

An immigration court of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) hears the related case.

If a judge rules that the deportation should proceed, the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) carries out a removal order.

Before removal is carried out, you might be able to leave the U.S. at your own expense. This is known as voluntary departure.
