Mortgage help and home repair loans after a disaster
====================================================

If you live in a presidentially declared disaster area, you may be eligible for mortgage assistance or financial help to repair or rebuild your home.

**Mortgage payments on your home after a disaster**
---------------------------------------------------

You must continue to pay your mortgage, even if a disaster damages your home. Contact your mortgage servicer if you are unable to pay. Ask your servicer if you qualify for
[mortgage forbearance](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/what-is-mortgage-forbearance-en-289/)
.

### **Mortgage help for homeowners with FHA loans**

Borrowers with mortgages backed by the Federal Housing Administration (FHA) can qualify for additional help.
[Answer this series of questions from the FHA](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/housing/sfh/nsc/qaho0121)
to determine what help you may qualify for.

Once you answer the questions and know your eligibility, contact your mortgage servicer.

**Get a home loan after a disaster**

To qualify for an SBA home loan:

* Your home must be in a presidentially declared disaster area.
* The loan must be for your primary home.
* The loan cannot duplicate benefits from insurance policies or benefit programs.

[register with FEMA at DisasterAssistance.gov](https://www.disasterassistance.gov/)

### **Learn how to get an FHA mortgage to replace your home**

The FHA makes it easier to get a mortgage to rebuild or buy a new home.

[The FHA offers mortgage insurance](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/housing/sfh/ins/203h-dft)
if your home is destroyed in a disaster. Under this program:

* You will not have to make a down payment.
* You will pay the FHA mortgage insurance as part of your mortgage payment.

Contact an FHA-approved lender to apply for an FHA disaster mortgage.
