Continuing disability benefits while working
============================================

You may be able to continue receiving government disability benefits while holding a paying job. Learn about the work rules for each program.

**Receiving SSI and SSDI while working**
----------------------------------------

If you receive Supplemental Security Income (SSI) and/or Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI), you may be able to work while keeping your benefits. But the benefit amount you receive may be reduced depending on how much money you earn from your job.

As of 2024, you may stop receiving SSDI benefits if you earn over $1,550 a month. But your eligibility to receive SSI while working will depend on which state you live in.

Read the publication
[Working While Disabled: How We Can Help [PDF, 1MB]](https://www.ssa.gov/pubs/EN-05-10095.pdf)
from the Social Security Administration. It explains:

* More about income limits and how work expenses can affect your SSI or SSDI benefits
* What information you must report to Social Security as an SSI or SSDI recipient if you start or stop working, or if your income changes
* Ticket to Work and other employment support programs that help SSI and SSDI recipients train for and find jobs

**Receiving Medicaid while working**
------------------------------------

Visit Social Security's
[Continued Medicaid Eligibility page](https://www.ssa.gov/disabilityresearch/wi/1619b.htm)
to find:

* The qualifications for continuing Medicaid coverage while working
* The earnings threshold for your state. This is the most you can earn and still receive Medicaid.
