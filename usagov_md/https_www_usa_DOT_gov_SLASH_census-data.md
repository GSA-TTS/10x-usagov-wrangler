**What is the U.S. Census?**
----------------------------

The U.S. Census Bureau provides data about the nationâs people and economy. Every 10 years, it conducts a census counting every resident in the United States. The most recent census was in 2020.

Who must participate?
---------------------

By law, all U.S. residents are required to take part in the census. To protect peopleâs privacy, all personal information collected by the census is confidential for 72 years.

**How population data affects your area**
-----------------------------------------

Your census response can help determine how much federal funding your community gets. This affects public services like hospitals, fire departments, and schools.

Leaders also use census population data to divide the seats in state legislatures and in the U.S. House of Representatives.
