How to visit or send money to a prisoner
========================================

If you know someone who is in prison, you may be able to support them by visiting or sending them money. Find out how to support someone in federal or state prison.

**Visit or send money to someone in state or local prison**
-----------------------------------------------------------

Options for visiting or sending money to inmates in state and local prisons vary. Contact the
[state or local corrections department](/state-corrections)
for more information.

**Send money to someone in federal prison**
-------------------------------------------

People in federal prison have bank-type accounts that they can use to buy things from the prison commissary. You can deposit money into a federal inmate's account electronically or through a postal money order by mail.

The Bureau of Prisons (BOP) recommends completing these four steps before visiting someone in federal prison:

1. Find out which prison the person you are visiting is in.
2. Get approval from the prison to visit.
3. Review the prisonâs rules and regulations before visiting.
4. View the prisonâs visiting schedule and find out how to get there.
