### **Types of immigrant work visas and their requirements**

There are five categories of immigrant visas for permanent workers. These categories include EB-2 and EB-3 visas for professionals with advanced degrees and skilled workers. The requirements to qualify vary depending on the type of visa.

[See the 5 categories of permanent worker visas.](https://www.uscis.gov/working-in-the-united-states/permanent-workers)

* Each category is intended for different professions or skills.
* Some categories require you to have a job offer from a U.S. employer (sponsor) before submitting your visa application.
* Some categories require the employer (sponsor) to file an application with the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) and obtain a labor certification from the Department of Labor (DOL).

  .

Once you have been certified, file your certification along with
