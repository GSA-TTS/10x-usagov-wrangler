How to look up prisoners and prison records
===========================================

You can search for prisoners and prison records based on when and where someone was incarcerated. Find out how to look up federal, state, or local prison records.

**Look up state and local prison records**
------------------------------------------

For state and local prison records, contact the
[state's department of corrections](/state-corrections)
.

**Look up federal prison records from 1870 to present**
-------------------------------------------------------

### Recent federal prison records (1982 - present)

#### Locate or learn about an inmate

[Use the Federal Bureau of Prisons (BOP) inmate locator](https://www.bop.gov/inmateloc/)
to find outÂ when a prisoner is or was expected to be released.

To learn more details about an inmate, find out how to submit a Freedom of Information Act
[(FOIA) request](https://www.bop.gov/foia/index.jsp#tabs-5)
to BOP.

#### Get a copy of your own prison records

If you are looking for your own prison records, complete and submit
[Form DOJ-361 [PDF, 17KB]](https://www.bop.gov/inmates/docs/certification_of_identity.pdf)
along with a
[FOIA request](https://www.bop.gov/foia/index.jsp#tabs-5)
. This form helps BOP confirm your identity so your private prison records are not wrongfully disclosed.
