Veteran disability benefits
===========================

The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) pays monthly disability benefits to qualifying veterans. Find out how it works, if you are eligible, and how to file your claim.

**How VA disability pay works**
-------------------------------

The VA provides tax-free monthly payments to veterans with qualifying disabilities. If you are eligible, the VA will assign you a disability rating based on the severity of your condition. This rating determines how much disability pay you can get each month.
