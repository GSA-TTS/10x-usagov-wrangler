Head Start offers learning and development services for children up to age 3 (Early Head Start) and ages 3 to 5 (traditional Head Start). Local organizations and school districts run Head Start programs.

Head Start can connect your family with free local medical and dental services. Some Early Head Start programs also provide prenatal services for pregnant women.

### Find out if your family is eligible for free Head Start services

Head Start is free to families with a low income, at or below federal poverty guidelines. Check the
[poverty guidelines](https://aspe.hhs.gov/topics/poverty-economic-mobility/poverty-guidelines)
to see if your family qualifies.

Regardless of income, children are eligible for Head Start and Early Head Start if:

* Your family receives public assistance (TANF, SSI, or SNAP)
* Children are in foster care
* Children are experiencing homelessness

Even if your familyâs income and situation does not meet these Head Start qualifications, you may still be eligible if you spend more than 30% of your gross annual income on housing expenses.
