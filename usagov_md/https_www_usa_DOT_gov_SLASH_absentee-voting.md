Absentee voting and voting by mail
==================================

Absentee voting and vote-by-mail allow voting before Election Day by mail or drop-off. Learn how they are different, how to get a ballot in the U.S. or abroad, and meet deadlines.

What is the difference between absentee voting and vote-by-mail?
----------------------------------------------------------------

States allow voters who cannot or do not want to vote in person to cast mail-in or drop off ballots through absentee voting or vote-by-mail programs. Absentee and mail-in ballots can be cast for both primary and general elections.

### Absentee voting

Although most states have absentee voting, deadlines and rules on who can take part vary. Some states require an excuse to vote absentee. Others do not. In most states, you must request an absentee ballot to vote in each election. But in some states, you may qualify to sign up to receive absentee ballots for every election.
[Learn if your state offers permanent absentee voting.](https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/table-3-states-with-permanent-absentee-voting-lists)

### Vote-by-mail

Instead of absentee voting programs, some states offer vote-by-mail (also known as all-mail) programs. They automatically send ballots to all registered voters in the state before Election Day.
[See which states offer vote-by-mail programs.](https://www.ncsl.org/elections-and-campaigns/table-18-states-with-all-mail-elections)

How to vote absentee or by mail if you live in the U.S.
-------------------------------------------------------

Get your ballot from your state or territory.

Visit
[Can I Vote](https://www.nass.org/can-i-vote/absentee-early-voting)
and choose your state from the dropdown menu. It will take you right to your state's absentee voting or vote-by-mail page.

Your state may require you to have a valid excuse to vote absentee. Acceptable excuses vary by state. Most include:

* Being unable to get to your polling place due to illness, injury, or disability
* Being on business travel or vacation outside of your county or city of residence on Election Day
* Being a student at an out-of-state college or university

#### **Know your stateâs absentee and vote-by-mail ballot deadlines**

* Make sure you follow your stateâs deadlines for requesting and returning your ballot.
  [See your stateâs voting deadlines](https://www.usvotefoundation.org/state-election-dates-and-deadlines)
  . And note whether the deadline is for when your ballot must be postmarked or for when it must be received by the election office.

#### **How to change your address if you are an absentee or vote-by-mail voter**

If you have moved, you must update your voter registration with your new address before requesting an absentee or vote-by-mail ballot. In some states, you may need to submit a new voter registration form. In other states, there may be a form you can sign and mail letting your stateâs election office know your address has changed. Or you may be able to change your address online. Contact your
[state or local election office](https://www.usvotefoundation.org/election-offices)
to find out how to update your address.

#### **Know your options for returning your absentee or vote-by-mail ballot**

Check with your
[state or local election office](https://www.usvotefoundation.org/vote/eoddomestic.htm)
to learn about other ways to return your ballot besides postal mail. Some states have ballot drop boxes. Many let you return your ballot in person at your local election office or another location.

How to vote absentee if you are in the military or outside of the U.S.
----------------------------------------------------------------------

#### **Who can and cannot vote absentee**

* Military members and families stationed outside their legal voting residence can vote absentee.
* U.S. citizens outside of the U.S. who used to live in the U.S. can vote absentee.
* U.S. citizens born outside the U.S. who have never resided in the U.S. may not be able to vote absentee. Check
  [the rules of the state where the personâs parent or legal guardian last resided](https://www.fvap.gov/citizen-voter/reside)
  .

#### **Register and request an absentee ballot in one step**

If you are in the military, a family member of a military service member, or a U.S. citizen outside of the U.S., you can register to vote and request an absentee ballot in one step. Complete the
[Federal Post Card Application (FCPA) online](https://www.fvap.gov/fpca-privacy-notice)
. You must
[know your voting residence](https://www.fvap.gov/info/laws/voting-residence)
for this.

You received an absentee or vote-by-mail ballot but want to vote in person on Election Day
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* You might be able to vote in person on Election Day, even if you received a ballot in the mail. Every state has different rules, so check with your
  [state or local election office](https://www.usvotefoundation.org/election-offices)
  for the specific procedures. Typically:
  + You would take the ballot you received in the mail to your designated polling place on Election Day.
  + Depending on your state's rules, you might be able to:
    - Exchange your uncast absentee ballot for an in-person ballot
    - Complete your absentee ballot and hand it in, or
    - Cast a provisional ballot
