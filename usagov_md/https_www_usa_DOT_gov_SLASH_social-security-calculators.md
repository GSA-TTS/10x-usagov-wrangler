Use Social Security retirement calculators to estimate your benefits
====================================================================

Knowing how much you may receive from Social Security is important for retirement planning. Social Securityâs benefit calculators give you a preview of your future payments.

How much Social Security you may get when you retire will depend on:

* Your earnings over your lifetime
* The age at which you will begin receiving benefits
* Whether you will be eligible to receive a spouse's benefit instead of your own
