Nonimmigrant visa holders are typically required to have a work permit (EAD) before being hired to work in the U.S. In most cases, obtaining a work permit will allow you to work for any employer. And you do not have to work in any specific trade or profession.

You may not need a work permit if you are a:

* Nonimmigrant who is authorized to work in the U.S. for a specific employer
* Lawful or conditional permanent resident
