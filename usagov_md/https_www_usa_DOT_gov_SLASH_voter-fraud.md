Voter fraud, voter suppression, and other election crimes
=========================================================

If you witness or suspect election crimes, you can report them. Learn where to report voter fraud and voting rights violations.

**How to report a violation of your voting rights, intimidation, or suppression**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

If you experience or witness a voting rights violation, including voter intimidation or suppression, you can report it by:

* Calling 1-800-253-3931 or
  [filing a report online with the U.S. Department of Justice](https://civilrights.justice.gov/report/)
  Civil Rights Division, Voting Section
* Contacting your
  [state or territorial election office](/state-election-office)

**How to report voter fraud**
-----------------------------

If you suspect someone has committed voter fraud, report it to your
[state or territorial election office](/state-election-office)
. You can also report it to:

* A
  [local FBI office](https://www.fbi.gov/contact-us/field-offices)

What are the types of voter and election crimes?
------------------------------------------------

Federal election crimes fall into three broad categories:

* **Campaign finance crimes**
  , such as when candidates accept funds that violate the amounts or donors permitted under the law
* **Voter fraud and voter registration fraud**
  , such as when someone illegally casts a vote in the name of a dead person or someone who has moved. Many states have strengthened their
  [voter ID requirements](/voter-id)
  to help stop voter fraud.
* **Civil rights violations**
  involving voter intimidation, coercion, threats, and other tactics to suppress a personâs ability to vote

You have the right to cast your vote in private. There is no law against asking someone who they are voting for. But you do not have to share that information with anyone if you do not want to.
