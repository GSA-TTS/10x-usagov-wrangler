Child Tax Credit and Credit for Other Dependents
================================================

If you are responsible for a child or other dependent, you may qualify for a credit on your tax return.

**Claim the Child Tax Credit**
------------------------------

Even if you do not normally file a tax return, you may qualify for a tax break by claiming the Child Tax Credit. Your eligibility depends on your income, the childâs age, how you are related to the child, and other factors.

[Learn how the Child Tax Credit works](https://www.irs.gov/credits-deductions/individuals/child-tax-credit)
, if you qualify, how to claim it, and what additional credits you may be able to claim.

**Credit for Other Dependents**
-------------------------------

If you are not eligible for the Child Tax Credit, you may be able to claim the Credit for Other Dependents. The maximum amount you can receive for each dependent is $500. Your eligibility will depend on your income and whether your dependent qualifies.
