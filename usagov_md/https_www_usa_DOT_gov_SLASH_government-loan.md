How to get a government loan or grant
=====================================

Government loans can help pay for education, housing, business, and more. Federal grants are for organizations. Learn the differences between grants and loans and how to apply.

**Government loans, grants, and benefits are different**
--------------------------------------------------------

**Government loans**
- money you borrow from the federal government and that you repay with interest. Government loans can help pay for:

* School
* Buying a house
* Starting or growing a business.

**Federal government grants**
- typically not given to people for personal expenses. Grants are for organizations that work with programs and projects funded by the government, including:

* Universities
* Research labs
* Nonprofit organizations
* State and local governments
* Law enforcement
* Businesses

Your organization can
[find federal grants on Grants.gov](https://grants.gov/learn-grants/grant-programs)
or
[contact your state or territory](https://www.usa.gov/state-governments)
to find funding opportunities locally.

**Government benefits**
- help people with food, health care, housing, and more. Each benefits program has its own eligibility rules, application process, and deadlines. Unlike government loans, government benefits usually do not need to be repaid. If you need financial help,

* [Farmers and ranchers](https://www.fsa.usda.gov/programs-and-services/farm-loan-programs/index)

**Applying for government loans**
---------------------------------

Each federal loan program has its own eligibility requirements, application process, and deadlines. To apply for a federal loan:

* Read about the programâs eligibility requirements, application process, and deadlines. Ask for help if you need it.
* Fill out the required forms and provide documentation. You might be asked to provide proof of income, identification, and information about what you need the loan for.

**Be aware of government âfree moneyâ scams**
-------------------------------------------------

Some people might try to trick you by offering fake government grants, loans, or benefits. If someone asks for your personal information or money to get a grant or loan, it is probably a scam.
