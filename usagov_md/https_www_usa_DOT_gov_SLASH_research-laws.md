**Is there a list of federal laws?**
------------------------------------

According to the Library of Congress, the total number of federal laws and amendments has not been tallied. Besides many volumes of the U.S. Statutes at Large that are published by year,
[there is no official, single list of all federal laws.](https://blogs.loc.gov/law/2013/03/frequent-reference-question-how-many-federal-laws-are-there/)
