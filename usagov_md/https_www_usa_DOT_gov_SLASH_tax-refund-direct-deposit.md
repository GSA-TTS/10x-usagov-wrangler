Set up direct deposit to receive your tax refund
================================================

Get your tax refund faster through direct deposit instead of by mail. Learn how direct deposit works and what to do if your direct deposit information is incorrect.

**How to set up a direct deposit for your tax refund**
------------------------------------------------------

The IRS uses direct deposit to electronically issue tax refund payments directly into taxpayersâ financial accounts. In most cases, you will receive your tax refund in less than 21 days after you file your federal tax return.

To get your refund deposited directly into your bank account, select the direct deposit option when prompted by the tax software you are using. Then, enter your account and routing numbers of the bank account you want your refund deposited into.

**How to recover your refund if your direct deposit information is incorrect**
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Every year you file your tax return, you must enter your direct deposit information to get your refund electronically. This information includes your bank information.

If you enter your information incorrectly, you can call the IRS at 1-800-829-1040 to stop your direct deposit. This option only works if your refund has not yet been posted.

If your refund has already been posted,
