Voter registration deadlines
============================

Every state has its own voter registration deadline. Find yours to make sure you can register in time to vote.

Every state except North Dakota requires people to register if they want to become voters. Depending on your state, the deadline to register to vote could be as much as a month before an election.

[Check your voter registration deadline by selecting your state on vote.gov.](https://vote.gov/register)
You can also check your
