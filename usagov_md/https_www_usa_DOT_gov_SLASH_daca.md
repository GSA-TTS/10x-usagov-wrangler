DACA temporarily delays the deportation of people without documentation who came to the U.S. as children. Renewal is not automatic. Learn how to keep your DACA status.

U.S. district courts have determined that the DACA policy "is illegal." But those who had obtained DACA on or before July 16, 2021, will still be protected. They will also be able to renew their DACA and work authorization requests.
