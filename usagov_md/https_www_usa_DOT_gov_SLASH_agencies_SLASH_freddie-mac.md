Freddie Mac
===========

Freddie Mac's mission is to serve America's homebuyers, homeowners, and renters by equitably providing liquidity, stability, and affordability to the housing market. Freddie Mac is not a federal agency. It is a government-sponsored enterprise under the conservatorship of the Federal Housing Finance Agency (FHFA).
