Resolve student loan payment problems
=====================================

If you are struggling to repay your student loan, contact your loan servicer. Not paying your student loan has serious consequences. Learn how to get your payments back on track.

**Student loan deferment and forbearance**
------------------------------------------

If you are having trouble paying back your student loans, you may qualify for:

* Loan deferment - Payments are postponed. In most cases, the interest money you owe will continue to accrue (grow).
* Forbearance - Payments are suspended or reduced, but the interest you owe continues to accrue.

Both give you a temporary pause in your loan payments.

**Student loan delinquency and default**
----------------------------------------

If your student loan payment is one day late, your account is delinquent. If it stays delinquent, it will go into default.

To prevent default, contact your loan servicer right away. Default has serious financial consequences, including:

* Hurting your credit rating and your ability to buy a car or house or get a credit card
* Having your tax refunds withheld and applied toward your defaulted loan
* Having your wages garnished (withheld) to repay your loan

Consolidating student loans
---------------------------

If you are having trouble keeping track of and paying multiple federal student loans, you may be able to combine them into one loan at a lower interest rate.

1. Identify your loan problem.
