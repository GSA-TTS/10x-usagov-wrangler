Minimum wage
============

The Fair Labor Standards Act gives you the right to a minimum wage. The Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division enforces these rights.

What is minimum wage?
---------------------

Minimum wage is the lowest hourly wage an employer can legally pay an employee. Congress made minimum wage a law under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA). Enforced by the U.S. Department of Labor, FLSA establishes the federal minimum wage for employees who work at private companies and in federal, state, and local governments.

**Federal minimum wage**
------------------------

The federal minimum wage is $7.25 per hour. This rate applies to
[covered nonexempt workers](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fact-sheets/14-flsa-coverage)
.

The minimum wage for employees who receive tips is $2.13 per hour. The amount of tips plus the $2.13 must reach at least $7.25 per hour. If not, your employer must pay to make up the difference.

**State minimum wages**
-----------------------

Some states and cities set their own minimum wage rates. If the federal and local government minimum wages are different, the higher wage rate applies.
