How to get help collecting child support
========================================

A child support order legally requires a parent to help pay to raise a child. Your state or tribe can help you get, change, or enforce one, regardless of where the parent lives.

The government does not pay child support
-----------------------------------------

Federal and state governments do not pay child support. But they provide the help you may need to collect it from a parent.

How to establish a child support order
--------------------------------------

A court ruling or other legal procedure can establish a child support order.

[Find your state or tribal child support agency](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/css/map/state-and-tribal-child-support-agency-contacts)
and contact them for help getting the order. Start with them regardless of where the parent lives.
