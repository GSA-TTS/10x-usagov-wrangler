Check your federal or state tax refund status
=============================================

If you expect a federal or state tax refund, you can track its status. Learn how and what information you will need.

**Check your federal tax refund status**
----------------------------------------

Before checking on your refund, have the following ready:

* Social Security number or Individual Taxpayer Identification Number (ITIN)
* Filing status
* The exact whole dollar amount of your refund

Use the IRS
[Where's My Refund tool](https://www.irs.gov/refunds)
or the
[IRS2Go](https://www.irs.gov/help/irs2goapp)
mobile app to check your refund online. This is the fastest and easiest way to track your refund. The systems are updated once every 24 hours.

You can
[contact the IRS](/contact-irs)
to check on the status of your refund. If you call, wait times to speak with a representative can be long. But you can avoid the wait by using the automated phone system. Follow the message prompts when you call.

**Find out when to expect your federal tax refund**
---------------------------------------------------

The IRS generally issues refunds within 21 days of when you electronically filed your tax return, and longer for paper returns.
