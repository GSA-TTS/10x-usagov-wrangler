How to get a REAL ID and use it for travel
==========================================

The REAL ID Act is a law that sets higher security standards for state-issued driver's licenses and identification cards (IDs).

**How to get a REAL ID**
------------------------

When you apply for or renew your driverâs license or state identification card, you can choose to make it REAL ID-compliant. When you receive your new card, it will have the REAL ID star marking at the top right.

The process of getting a REAL ID and what documents you must provide depends on your state. In most cases, your state driverâs licensing agency will require you to bring:

* **Proof of identity**
  - To prove your identity, you can bring a U.S. birth certificate, U.S. passport, or Permanent Resident Card (Green Card) if you are a non-U.S. citizen.
* **Proof of a Social Security number**
  - You can provide your Social Security card, Form W-2, which shows your earnings for tax purposes, or a pay stub or paycheck from your job.
* **Proof of residency**
  - Your state department of motor vehicles may ask you for a deed, mortgage statement, lease agreement, utility bill, or bank statement to prove you are a state resident.

[Look up and visit your stateâs driverâs licensing agency website](/state-motor-vehicle-services)
to learn how to apply and what documentation you need.

**Why upgrade your license to a REAL ID?**
------------------------------------------

If you do not have a REAL ID-compliant driverâs license or state-issued ID, you will not be able to use it to:

* Board federally regulated commercial aircraft
* Access federal government facilities or military installations
* Enter nuclear power plants

[Visit the REAL ID website for more details and frequently asked questions.](https://www.dhs.gov/real-id)

**Check to see if your license or state ID is already REAL ID-compliant**
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

If your driver's license or state ID has a star in the upper right-hand corner, it is already REAL-ID-compliant. There is nothing more you need to do.

**Can I fly without a REAL ID?**
--------------------------------

Yes. If you do not upgrade your license or state ID, you can use a passport or
[one of these other acceptable forms of identification to fly](https://www.tsa.gov/travel/security-screening/identification)
.

**Can you still get a non-REAL ID-compliant license or state ID?**
------------------------------------------------------------------

You will still be able to get a driver's license or state ID card that is not REAL ID-compliant. But you will not be able to use it for air travel or to get into federal facilities or military installations.
