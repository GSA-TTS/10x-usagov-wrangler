Welfare benefits or Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF)
==================================================================

If you or your family are experiencing financial hardship, find out how you can get help paying for food, housing, and more.

**What is TANF?**
-----------------

Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF) is a federally funded, state-run program. Also known as welfare, TANF helps families pay for:

* Food
* Housing
* Home energy
* Child care

In addition to cash assistance for living expenses, many states offer job training and help with tuition payments for work-related education.

Each state or tribal government runs its TANF program differently and has a different name.

**Find out if you are eligible for TANF benefits and apply**
------------------------------------------------------------

Every state or tribal territory has its own TANF requirements for who can get financial help, services, or other benefits. You must be a resident of the state where you are applying.

[Find your local TANF office](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ofa/map/about/help-families)

**Check your TANF balance**
---------------------------

Every state issues TANF benefits electronically on a debit card or through direct deposit. But some also issue benefits with paper checks.

If you receive your benefits electronically:

* Check the receipt from the store where you made your purchase using a TANF card. Many stores will print the amount of money left on your card.
* Find out if your state offers a mobile app to help manage your benefits and check your available balance.
* Look for a phone number on the back of your card. The number may be for your local TANF office, which can tell you your balance.

**Report TANF fraud, ask a question, or file a complaint**
----------------------------------------------------------

If you suspect possible welfare fraud or have a question or complaint about TANF:

* [Find your local TANF office](https://www.acf.hhs.gov/ofa/map/about/help-families)
* [File a complaint online with the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) Office of Inspector General](https://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/report-fraud/)
