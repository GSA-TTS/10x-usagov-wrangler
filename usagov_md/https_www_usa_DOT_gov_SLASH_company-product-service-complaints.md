How to file a complaint about a companyâs products or services
================================================================

If you have an issue with a product or service, learn the steps to file a complaint with the company. Or get consumer or legal help if you cannot resolve your complaint.

Collect documents related to your purchase
------------------------------------------

Before you make a complaint, gather any documentation about the sale of the product or service first. These documents can include:

* Sales receipts
* Warranties
* Contracts
* Work orders
* Email messages or records of any contact you have had with the seller

Contact the company about your complaint
----------------------------------------

If you have a complaint about a companyâs products or services, contact them first before you seek help elsewhere. Explain your problem to the company by calling, web chatting, or sending them a formal complaint letter.

Use this
[sample complaint letter](https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/sample-customer-complaint-letter)
as a guide to help you explain the problem and what you want done to resolve it. Then send it to:

* A salesperson or customer service representative. Search for a companyâs customer service contact information on their website. Look for links that say "contact us," "customer service," "about us," or "privacy statement."
* Take your complaint to a company's management if a salesperson or customer service representative did not help.

Find help if the company does not solve your complaint
------------------------------------------------------

If the seller does not resolve the issue, a government office, a consumer organization, or the legal system may be able to help.

### File a complaint with government or consumer programs

* File a complaint with your
  [local consumer protection office](/state-consumer)
  .
* Notify the
  [Better Business Bureau (BBB)](https://www.bbb.org/)
  in your area about your problem. The BBB tries to resolve complaints against companies.
* [Report scams and suspicious communications to the Federal Trade Commission.](https://reportfraud.ftc.gov/?orgcode=USAGOV)
* Contact
  [econsumer.gov](https://www.econsumer.gov/#nb)
  if you are complaining about items you bought online from a seller outside the U.S.

### Seek legal help for your complaint about a company

If contacting the company, a government agency, or a consumer organization does not work:

* You may be able to resolve your problem through the legal system.
  [Find free or low-cost legal help.](/legal-aid)
* [Consider an alternative dispute resolution process](https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/solving-customer-problems-returns-refunds-and-other-resolutions#dispute)
  , such as arbitration, conciliation, or mediation.
