Avoid foreclosure
=================

Foreclosure happens when a lender seizes and sells a property because the homeowner does not pay the mortgage. Learn what to do if your home is at risk of foreclosure.

Important
---------

Ads and websites may offer to help you save your house from foreclosure but ask for money upfront. These may be scams.

What happens when you do not pay your mortgage
----------------------------------------------

When you buy a home or other type of property and do not pay the mortgage, the lender can start the foreclosure process. This is when a lender repossesses a property and sells it.

Communicate with your lender
----------------------------

As soon as you know that you are going to have trouble paying your mortgage:

* Contact your lender immediately and let them know you are having financial difficulties. This gives your lender time to work with you to create a financial plan.
* Do not stop paying your bills.
* Seek help early. Do not wait until you cannot make payments before you act.
