American money
==============

The United States dollar is the official currency of the U.S. and its territories. Learn about the bills and coins that make up U.S. currency.

**Paper money**
---------------

American paper currency comes in seven denominations: $1, $2, $5, $10, $20, $50, and $100.

The United States no longer issues bills in larger denominations, such as $500, $1,000, $5,000, and $10,000 bills. But they are still legal tender and may still be in circulation.

The U.S. Bureau of Engraving and Printing creates U.S. paper currency.
