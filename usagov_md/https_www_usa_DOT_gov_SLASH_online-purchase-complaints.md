Where to file a complaint about an online purchase
==================================================

If you have a complaint about a purchase you made online, learn how to resolve it with the seller or website. Or get additional help from a federal or state agency.

If you have a complaint about a product you bought online, try to resolve it by contacting the seller or website first.

If contacting the seller or website does not work, file a complaint with:

* Your
  [stateâs consumer protection office](/state-consumer)
* Your
  [stateâs attorney general](https://www.naag.org/find-my-ag/)
* The
  [Federal Trade Commission (FTC)](https://reportfraud.ftc.gov/?orgcode=USAGOV)
  for scams and suspicious communications
* [Econsumer.gov](https://www.econsumer.gov/en/SelectAType/1#crnt)
  if your purchase was from a seller outside of the U.S.
