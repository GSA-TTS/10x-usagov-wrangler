How to apply for or renew a U.S. tourist visa
=============================================

If you visit the U.S. for tourism or business, you may need a visitor visa, also known as a tourist visa. Learn how to get and renew this type of nonimmigrant visa.

**Find out if you need a visa to visit the U.S.**
-------------------------------------------------

Check if your country participates in the
[U.S. Visa Waiver Program (VWP)](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/tourism-visit/visa-waiver-program.html)
. If it does, you can get a waiver and will not need a visa. If you do not see your country listed, you will need a visitor visa.

If you qualify for a waiver, you will still need to get approval to travel to the U.S. through the Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA).
[Learn about ESTA and how to apply.](https://esta.cbp.dhs.gov/esta)

**Visitor (tourist) visas and other travel documents for entering the U.S.**
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

The visitor visa is a type of nonimmigrant visa for people who wish to temporarily enter the U.S. There are two categories:

* B-1 for business travel
* B-2 for tourism and medical treatment

[Learn about B-1 and B-2 visas](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/tourism-visit/visitor.html)
, including:

* Reasons you would need each type of visitor visa
* How to apply using Form DS-160
* What documents you will need
* Application fees
* How to prepare for your interview at your U.S. embassy or consulate

Along with your visa, you must bring a passport issued by your country of citizenship. When you arrive at your port of entry into the U.S., officials will issue you a Form I-94, which electronically records your arrival and departure dates.

**How to renew a visitor visa**
-------------------------------

The process to renew a visitor visa is the same as getting one for the first time.
[Follow the process to apply for a visitor visa from the Department of State.](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/tourism-visit/visitor.html)

[Find the contact information for your nearest U.S. embassy or consulate](https://www.usembassy.gov/)
and get information about visa renewals, including:

* Processing times
* Fees
* Your eligibility for an interview waiver

### Understand expiration dates for visas and I-94 forms

* The expiration date on your visa does not indicate the date on which you must depart the U.S.
  + The date you must depart the U.S. will be shown on your Form I-94. This date is determined by the Customs and Border Protection officer when you arrive at the port-of-entry into the U.S.
* You may renew your visitor visa before it expires. But you must renew it at a U.S. embassy or consulate in your home country.
  + Only diplomatic visa holders and their dependents can renew their visas while they are in the U.S.
