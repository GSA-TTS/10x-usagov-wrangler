Homeownership vouchers for first-time homebuyers
================================================

If you have a low income and want to buy your first home, the Housing Choice Voucher homeownership program could help. It may also help you pay monthly housing expenses.

info

Important
---------

The federal government does not offer grants or "free money" to individuals to buy a home. Websites and ads claiming to offer "free money from the government" are often scams.

**Eligibility: Homeownership vouchers are for Housing Choice Voucher recipients**
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To be eligible for the homeownership program, you must already be part of the Housing Choice Voucher (HCV) program. You must have a low income to be eligible for an HCV.

Your area may have waiting lists or open seasons for applying for HCVs.

**How to apply for a homeownership voucher**
--------------------------------------------

If you are an HCV recipient, you can apply to use your voucher for the homeownership program.

Some local areas do not have a homeownership program.

to see if it offers the homeownership program and to apply.
