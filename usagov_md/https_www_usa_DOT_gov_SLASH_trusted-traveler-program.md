Save time getting through airport security with Trusted Traveler Programs
=========================================================================

Trusted Traveler Programs, like TSA Precheck and Global Entry, can help reduce airport security and border crossing wait times. Learn about applying for and managing memberships.

**What is the Trusted Traveler Program, and how do you apply?**
---------------------------------------------------------------

The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) manages the Trusted Traveler Programs. These include
[TSA Precheck](https://www.tsa.gov/precheck)
and
[Global Entry](https://www.cbp.gov/travel/trusted-traveler-programs/global-entry)
. As a pre-approved member, you can use expedited lanes at U.S. airports and when entering the U.S. by land or sea. TSA Precheck is for travelers departing from U.S. airports. Global Entry is for travelers entering the U.S. from international destinations by air, land, or sea. There are also programs for entering the U.S. from Canada and Mexico.

To apply, you will need to pay a fee and provide documents proving your identity. Depending on the program, you may need to complete an interview. If approved, your program membership will last 5 years.
