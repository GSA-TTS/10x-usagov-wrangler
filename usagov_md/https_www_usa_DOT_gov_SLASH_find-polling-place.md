Find your polling place
=======================

Your polling place is where you go to vote in local, state, and federal elections. Find out where yours is located, its hours, and if you can change your polling place.

**Find out where to vote**
--------------------------

To find your polling place and its hours,
[contact your state or territorial election office](/state-election-office)
. Let them know if you need an accommodation for a disability.

You can also find your polling place by
[checking your voter registration](https://www.nass.org/can-i-vote/find-your-polling-place)
.

**Cast your vote at your assigned polling place or polling station**
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Your polling place is based on your residential address. Go to your assigned voting location. Your name will not be on the roster at any other location. Polling places are typically schools, community centers, and other public facilities. The site of your polling place may change from one election to the next, so check with your state's election office before Election Day.

**Can you change your voting location?**
----------------------------------------

You cannot change your polling location. Your state or local election office assigns your polling place, which is where you must vote. If you try to vote somewhere other than your assigned location, you may have to cast a provisional ballot, and your vote may not count.

If you move, follow the instructions to
[update your address on your voter registration](/change-voter-registration)
so you can be assigned a new polling place near your new home.

If you have a disability, you have the right to vote at an accessible polling place. But you may have to request it beforehand.
[Contact your state or election office](https://www.usa.gov/state-election-office)
to learn more about accommodations for voters with disabilities.
