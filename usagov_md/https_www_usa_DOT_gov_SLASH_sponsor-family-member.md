Family-based immigrant visas and sponsoring a relative
======================================================

If you are a U.S. citizen or permanent resident, you may be able to sponsor a family member for a Permanent Resident Card (Green Card). Learn about the process and who is eligible.

**Categories of people eligible for family immigrant visas**
------------------------------------------------------------

For the person you are sponsoring to become a permanent resident, you must first apply for a family-based immigrant visa. There are two categories of this type of visa:

### **Immediate relative visas**

These visas are for close relatives of U.S. citizens, such as spouses, unmarried children under 21, or parents. An unlimited number of visas are available for this visa category. These visas include:

* IR1 and CR1 for spouses
* IR2 for children
* IR5 for parents

### **Family preference visas**

A limited number of family preference visas are set aside each year for:

* Other relatives of a U.S. citizen, such as eligible children or siblings. These include:
  + F1 visas for unmarried children who are 21 years of age or older
  + F3 visas for married children
  + F4 visas for siblings
* The spouse and unmarried children of legal permanent residents (Green Card holders). These include:
  + F2A visas for spouses and unmarried children under the age of 21
  + F2B visas for unmarried children who are 21 years of age or older

Check the U.S. Department of Stateâs
[chart of immigrant visa categories to learn more about each category of immediate relative and family-sponsored visas](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/us-visas/visa-information-resources/all-visa-categories.html)
.

**How to apply for permanent residency for a family member**
------------------------------------------------------------

To sponsor your family member,
[submit a United States Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) Form I-130](https://www.uscis.gov/i-130)
. Each person you sponsor needs a separate Form I-130. You can submit the form online or by mail.

The process for your relative to immigrate to the U.S. requires that both you, as the sponsor, and your relative, as the visa applicant, complete the necessary steps.

The process is different depending on whether your family member is already in the U.S. or abroad.

* If your family member is in the U.S. - Learn about
  [Adjustment of Status](https://www.uscis.gov/green-card/green-card-processes-and-procedures/adjustment-of-status)
* If your family member is outside the U.S. - Learn the steps for
  [Consular Processing](https://www.uscis.gov/green-card/green-card-processes-and-procedures/consular-processing)

Submitting Form I-130 is the first step of the immigration visa process.
