Wrongful termination
====================

Wrongful termination happens when your employer fires you for an illegal reason. Learn what qualifies as wrongful discharge and the actions you can take.

**What is wrongful termination?**
---------------------------------

Your termination could be wrongful if your employer fired you:

* Due to discrimination
* In violation of a federal or state labor law
* Because you reported and refused to participate in harassment
* Because you reported and refused to conduct an illegal act or safety violation

Termination could also be considered wrongful if your employer fired you but did not follow their termination policies.

**What to do after wrongful termination**
-----------------------------------------

### Termination due to discrimination

If you were fired because of discrimination,
[file a report with the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC)](https://publicportal.eeoc.gov/Portal/Login.aspx)
.

### Termination in retaliation

If you were fired in retaliation for reporting unsafe or illegal work practices or products, you have whistleblower protections. Report your termination to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA).
[Find instructions for filing a whistleblower complaint.](https://www.osha.gov/whistleblower/WBComplaint)
