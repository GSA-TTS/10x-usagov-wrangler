How to change careers
=====================

Are you considering a career change in 2024? Maybe you have new interests, need to increase your earning potential, or want a less-stressful work environment?Â
  
  
If youâre ready to jump start, change, or advance your career path, let USAGov help you navigate the process.

Find a career thatâs a good fit
---------------------------------

Before applying for new jobs, explore different career options that align with your interests and existing skills.
[CareerOneStop](https://www.careeronestop.org/)
from the Department of Labor offers many resources to assist with this important part of the process. For example:

* The
  [Skills Matcher](https://www.careeronestop.org/Toolkit/Skills/skills-matcher.aspx)
  assesses how familiar you are with 40 different skill sets. It then suggests occupations based on your experience.
* The
  [Occupation Profile](https://www.careeronestop.org/Toolkit/Careers/Occupations/occupation-profile.aspx)
  database provides detailed information about more than 900 occupations, including job duties, typical earnings, education and training requirements.
* The
  [Interest Assessment](https://www.careeronestop.org/Toolkit/Careers/interest-assessment.aspx)
  takes into account the workplace activities you most enjoyâand those you donâtâthen shows careers that fit your interests.

Develop the skills for your new career
--------------------------------------

Once you identify the career you want to pursue, develop the skills you need to succeed. Check out these training resources:

* [Job Corps](https://www.jobcorps.gov/)
  is a free, comprehensive training program for youth ages 16 to 24 to get workplace skills in different industries.
* [The Veteransâ Employment and Training Service (VETS) program](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/vets)
  prepares veterans and service members for meaningful careers. It provides employment resources and promotion opportunities while protecting your rights.
* Most states offer job training programs.

Find your job
-------------

When youâre ready to apply for your next job, federal and local community resources can help you identify available opportunities:

* [USAJOBS](https://www.usajobs.gov/)
  guides you through the federal job application process. Look across a wide range of career fields, create a profile to apply, and sign up for search results.
* The
  [Veterans Job Matcher](https://www.careeronestop.org/Veterans/Toolkit/match-veteran-jobs.aspx)
  helps you transition to a civilian career by identifying jobs that match your military skills.
* [American Job Centers](https://www.benefits.gov/benefit/87)
  connect applicants with local businesses and available training.
* [Public libraries](https://www.careeronestop.org/LocalHelp/CommunityServices/find-libraries.aspx)
  offer free, personalized help with your job search.

Changing careers can be exciting and scary.
