How to get dual citizenship or nationality
==========================================

Having dual citizenship, also known as dual nationality, means being a citizen of the United States and another country at the same time.

**Learn about the requirements for dual citizenship**
-----------------------------------------------------

Whether you were born an American citizen or became one through naturalization, if you have dual citizenship, you:

* Owe allegiance to both the U.S. and a foreign country
* Must use a U.S. passport to enter and leave the U.S.
* Do not have to choose one nationality over the other. As a U.S. citizen, you may naturalize in another country without risking your U.S. citizenship.

------------------------

Your eligibility to become a dual citizen depends on the policies of the second country where you are applying for citizenship.

### Dual citizenship if you are a citizen of another country

Some countries allow people to keep their citizenship after becoming U.S. citizens, while others do not.

[Contact the other countryâs embassy or consulate](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/consularnotification/ConsularNotificationandAccess.html)
to find out if they recognize dual U.S. citizenship.

If you qualify for dual citizenship, you must first immigrate to the U.S. Then you must become a permanent U.S. resident before being eligible for U.S. citizenship.
