How to check your immigration case status and find processing times
===================================================================

If you filed an immigration application or petition with the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS), you can check the progress of your caseâs status online or by phone. And learn how long it may take to process it.

**Check your immigration case status**
--------------------------------------

**Online:**
Use the case status online tool to check for updates about your immigration case. You will need your 13-character receipt number from your application or petition.

**By phone:**
If you are calling from the U.S., contact the USCIS Contact Center at 1-800-375-5283 or TTY 1-800-767-1833. If you are outside the U.S., call 212-620-3418 or contact a
[USCIS international field office](https://www.uscis.gov/about-us/find-a-uscis-office/international-immigration-offices)
.

If you applied for a visa, you can check your application status in the
[U.S. Department of State's Visa Status Check portal](https://ceac.state.gov/CEACStatTracker/Status.aspx)
. To do so, select the type of visa you applied for (immigrant or nonimmigrant) and enter your case number.

**Check immigration case processing times**
-------------------------------------------

Even if you have not filed an application with USCIS, you can still find out how long processing may take by using
[USCISâ case processing time tool](https://egov.uscis.gov/processing-times/)
. When you use the tool, you will need to select:

* The form and form category you have filed or intend to file
* The USCIS office handling your case
