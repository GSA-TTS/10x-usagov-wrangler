Federal campaign finance laws
=============================

Federal law puts limits on campaign contributions to candidates for president and Congress. Learn about contribution limits and campaign financial reporting rules.

**Campaign finance laws and contributing to a federal candidate**
-----------------------------------------------------------------

The Federal Election Commission (FEC) enforces the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 (FECA). The act limits the amount of money individuals and political organizations can give to a candidate running for federal office.

### How much can you donate to a political campaign

You can donate to more than one candidate in each federal election. The current contribution limits are:

| Primary election | General election |
| --- | --- |
| $3,300 to each candidate | $3,300 to each candidate |

**Can candidates spend their own money on their own campaigns?**
----------------------------------------------------------------

Candidates can spend their own personal funds on their campaign without limits. But they must report the amount they spend to the Federal Election Commission (FEC).

**What campaign funds do candidates have to report in federal elections?**
--------------------------------------------------------------------------

The FECA requires candidates for president, Senate, and the House of Representatives to report:

* The names of the individuals and political organizations contributing to their campaigns and the amounts
* How the candidates spend the money they receive and the amounts

**How the Federal Election Commission regulates campaign finance law**
----------------------------------------------------------------------

The Federal Election Commission (FEC) oversees the enforcement of laws specified under FECA by:

* Setting campaign contribution limits for individuals and groups
* Overseeing public funding used in presidential elections
* Tracking campaign finance data
