Retirement planning tools
=========================

A retirement plan is a guide to reach your retirement goals. These tools can help you create a retirement plan to live by.

**Savings planning worksheets**
-------------------------------

[Use this set of interactive worksheets from the Department of Labor to plan for retirement.](https://www.askebsa.dol.gov/savingsfitness/worksheets)
They can help you manage your finances and begin your savings plan. You will learn how to:

* Set your saving goals and timelines
* Decide how much to save each year
* Organize your financial documents

**Plan for Social Security retirement benefits**
------------------------------------------------

You can start receiving Social Security retirement benefits as early as age 62. But the later you wait to apply for benefits, the higher your payments will be. However, after age 70, your benefit amount no longer increases.

Sign in or create a personal
[*my*
Social Security account](https://www.ssa.gov/myaccount/)
to get an estimate of your future Social Security retirement benefits.

You can also use a variety of
[Social Security benefit calculators](https://www.ssa.gov/benefits/calculators/)
to find your full retirement age, estimate benefits for a spouse, and get a more detailed look at your future benefits.

Discover retirement benefits from the government
------------------------------------------------

Use
[USAGov's benefit finder tool](/benefit-finder/retirement)
to find retirement benefits that may help with living expenses, health care, medications, and more.

If you are a federal employee, visit the
[OPM Retirement Center](https://www.opm.gov/retirement-center/)
to learn about federal retirement benefits and resources.

**Planning tools from retirement plans**
----------------------------------------

You may have access to retirement planning tools through your 401k or IRA. The company that manages your retirement account may have tools to track your saving progress.

**Planning for cost of living**
-------------------------------

If you plan to move to another city for retirement, cost of living matters.

in your current home to potential places you would move to when you retire.
