U.S. citizen born abroad: how to get a copy of your birth certificate or report
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The U.S. embassy or consulate in your birth country issued a consular report of birth abroad (CRBA) if your parents reported your birth to them. The CRBA serves the same purpose as a U.S. birth certificate. See
[how to replace a consular report of birth abroad](https://travel.state.gov/content/travel/en/records-and-authentications/requesting-a-vital-record-as-a-u-s--citizen/replace-amend-CRBA.html)
.

--------------------------------------------------------------

Check with your
[birth stateâs vital records office](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/w2w/index.htm)
for what it requires. Most states have another way to verify your identification, such as:

* Your sworn statement of identity
* A notarized letter and a copy of the photo ID from the mother or father listed on your birth certificate

If you cannot get a copy of your birth certificate, try to
[replace your driver's license](/state-motor-vehicle-services)
