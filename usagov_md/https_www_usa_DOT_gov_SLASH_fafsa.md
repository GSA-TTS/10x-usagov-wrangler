Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)
================================================

Use the Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA) to learn if you are eligible for grants, scholarships, work-study programs, and loans for college or career school.

[Begin the FAFSA application](https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa)

**Applying for federal student aid**
------------------------------------

Completing and submitting the FAFSA is free and gives you access to the largest source of financial aid for school. You must submit your FAFSA application on time to be considered for federal student aid. States and colleges also use FAFSA information to award their own financial aid packages.

### **FAFSA deadlines**

* For the school year 2024-25, the federal deadline to submit the FAFSA is June 30, 2025.
* For the school year 2025-26, the federal deadline to submit the FAFSA is June 30, 2026.

Many states use the FAFSA for their financial aid programs.
[See the state deadlines.](https://studentaid.gov/apply-for-aid/fafsa/fafsa-deadlines)

### **Create a FAFSA account and log in**

[Create an account](https://studentaid.gov/fsa-id/create-account/launch)
and get a Federal Student Aid (FSA) ID. You can use your FSA ID right away to sign and submit your first FAFSA form. But to use your FSA ID for anything else, you will have to wait up to three days for your information to be confirmed by the Social Security Administration (SSA).

[Log in to the FAFSA](https://studentaid.gov/fsa-id/sign-in/landing)
if you already have an account.

### **Fill out the FAFSA**

Avoid financial aid scams
