Find an immigration detention facility

[To use the Online Detainee Locator System](https://locator.ice.gov/odls/#/search)
, you can either enter the person's:

* Name, country of birth, and birth date, or
* 9-digit A-number, which may be printed on correspondences from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security or the Executive Office for Immigration Review

If you cannot find someone who has been detained by immigration using the online system, contact an
[ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations (ERO) field office](https://www.ice.gov/contact/field-offices)
.

If you know the facility where the person is being held, contact the
