Military survivor benefits and life insurance
=============================================

Active duty, veterans, and retirees may be eligible to enroll in programs to provide for their survivors. Find out about military and veterans survivor benefits and life insurance.

Other options provide coverage for qualifying injuries or service-connected disabilities. Learn more about what life insurance programs are available based on your situation.

### **Life insurance for active duty service members**
