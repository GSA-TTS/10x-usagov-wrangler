SSDI and SSI benefits for people with disabilities
==================================================

Learn how you may be eligible for benefits through Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) or Supplemental Security Income (SSI) if you have a disability or are 65 or over.

**Learn the difference between SSDI and SSI**
---------------------------------------------

* SSDI is tied to your work history. It pays benefits to you and certain members of your family if you:
  + Have a disability and
  + Worked enough years to qualify and paid Social Security taxes during the years you worked
* SSI does not require you to have a work history. It provides you with money to cover basics like food, clothing, and housing if you are 65 or older or have a disability.

[Learn more about and compare SSDI and SSI benefits.](https://www.ssa.gov/redbook/eng/overview-disability.htm)

### **Can you get SSI and SSDI benefits together?**

Depending on your eligibility, you may be able to collect SSDI and SSI benefits at the same time. This is known as receiving âconcurrentâ benefits. When you are ready, you can apply for both benefits together. After you apply, the Social Security Administration will tell you if you qualify for one or both programs.

If you receive both benefits, find out
[how returning to work could affect your eligibility](https://www.ssa.gov/redbook/eng/supportsexample.htm)
.

**Find out if you are eligible for SSDI and apply**
---------------------------------------------------

Your eligibility for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) is based on your age, disability, and how long you worked. To find out if you are eligible for SSDI,
[use the Social Security benefits questionnaire](https://www.ssa.gov/prepare/check-eligibility-for-benefits)
.

Your spouse or former spouse and your children may be eligible for benefits when you start getting SSDI.
