Overtime pay
============

If you are eligible, the Fair Labor Standards Act gives you the right to earn overtime pay. The Department of Laborâs Wage and Hour Division enforces this right.

Employers must pay overtime if:

* [You are a covered nonexempt employee](https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/fact-sheets/14-flsa-coverage)
* You work more than 40 hours during a workweek

The overtime rate must be at least 1.5 times the amount of your hourly pay rate. Your employer must pay you at the overtime rate for the extra hours you worked.

Use the Department of Laborâs
[overtime pay calculator](https://webapps.dol.gov/elaws/otcalculator.htm)
to estimate how much overtime pay you may earn.
