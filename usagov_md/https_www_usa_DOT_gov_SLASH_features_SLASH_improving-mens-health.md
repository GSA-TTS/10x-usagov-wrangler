Improving menâs health
========================

Did you know the life expectancy for U.S. men is nearly six years less than women? This is often due to higher instances of life-threatening conditions and not getting regular health checkups or preventative screenings. Explore this guide to learn about common issues and ways to improve your health.Â

**Issues impacting menâs health**
-----------------------------------

Men are more likely to die from chronic and serious diseases like:

* **Heart disease:**
  [Men are at an increased risk for heart attacks and strokes](https://www.cdc.gov/heart-disease/about/men-and-heart-disease.html)
  , two leading causes of death among men. Nearly 350,000 men die of cardiovascular disease every year.
* **Cancer:**
  [The cancer rate among men is higher than for women](https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/features/cancer-and-men.html)
  .
* **Mental health:**
  [Men die by suicide nearly four times as often as women](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/men-and-mental-health)
  .

The good news? There are simple ways to address common issues. Discover options available to you such as:

* **Routine health screenings and doctor appointments:**
  [Regular preventative health screenings can help identify signs of serious illness](https://health.gov/myhealthfinder/doctor-visits/regular-checkups)
  before they become deadly. For example,
  [early detection of prostate cancer](https://www.cancer.gov/types/prostate/patient/prostate-screening-pdq)
  can greatly improve chances for recovery. Regular check ups can also develop relationships with doctors and improve awareness of warning signs.
* **Lifestyle choices:**
  [Guard your health against serious health conditions with everyday activities](https://cdc.gov/healthyweight/index.html)
  like:
  + Eating a healthy diet
  + Exercising
  + Getting enough sleep.
  + [Drinking alcohol in moderation](https://www.cdc.gov/alcohol/about-alcohol-use/moderate-alcohol-use.html)
    .
* **Mental health support:**
  Men often fear judgment when facing mental health challenges. Encourage the men in your life to seek help for issues if you think something is wrong or troubling them.
  [Remember: you are not alone, and help is available](https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/caring-for-your-mental-health)
