Estimate your college cost
==========================

Online tools and calculators can help you estimate a specific collegeâs costs, compare schools more accurately, and choose one that best fits your needs.

**Know what college costs include**
-----------------------------------

Start by understanding
[what is included in the total cost of college](https://studentaid.gov/resources/prepare-for-college/students/choosing-schools/consider-costs)
. Look at the costs for the specific schools you are considering and identify:

* Other expenses to plan for
* Ways to cut costs
* How to compare the costs between different colleges

**Use tools to help you find schools**
--------------------------------------

These tools from the Department of Education can help you find the best colleges for your budget.

* [College Navigator](https://nces.ed.gov/collegenavigator/)
  - Search for schools by location, majors, tuition and fees, enrollment numbers, and more. The navigator lets you build a list of schools so you can look at side-by-side comparisons.
* [College Scorecard](https://collegescorecard.ed.gov/)
  - Browse data to compare costs, fields of study, salaries and debts of graduates, and more from different schools.
* [Net Price Calculator Center](https://collegecost.ed.gov/net-price)
  - Use this college cost calculator to look up schools you want to attend to find the estimated price you will pay. It factors in scholarships and grants the school might award you.

List the potential schools you want to attend on your
[Free Application for Federal Student Aid (FAFSA)](https://studentaid.gov/h/apply-for-aid/fafsa)
. The schools will be notified and may make financial aid offers.

**Calculate costs after receiving financial aid offers**
--------------------------------------------------------

Once you receive a financial aid offer,
[learn how to calculate the school's actual net cost](https://studentaid.gov/complete-aid-process/comparing-aid-offers)
. This is the amount you will pay, minus financial aid and any money you have saved for your education.

If you get more than one offer, compare them using the
[Your Financial Path to Graduation](https://www.consumerfinance.gov/paying-for-college/your-financial-path-to-graduation/)
tool from the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. It can help you understand each offer you receive. It also shows how much in costs you will have to cover and if you can afford the school.
