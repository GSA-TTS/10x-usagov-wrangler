Types of student financial aid
==============================

Learn about the most common ways to get help paying for college and trade or career school. Options include grants, loans, scholarships, and work-study.

Visit the
[Types of Financial Aid](https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types)
page on the Federal Student Aid website. You will learn about funding you can get from the government, your school, and private sources, including:

* **Grants**
  - Federal grants are sources of financial aid that generally do not have to be repaid unless your educational or financial situation changes. One of the most common is the Federal Pell Grant.
  [Learn about the types of student grants, their eligibility requirements, and when they must be repaid.](https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/grants)
* **Scholarships**
  - This type of free money from nonprofit and private organizations may be based on academic merit, talent, financial need, or a particular area of study.
  [Learn about finding and applying for scholarships.](https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/scholarships)
* **Work-study**
  - The Federal Work-Study Program allows you to pay for school by earning money at a part-time job. You will earn at least the current federal minimum wage at a job that may be related to your studies.
  [Learn more about the work-study program.](https://studentaid.gov/understand-aid/types/work-study)
* **Loans**
  - When you receive a student loan, you are borrowing money that you must pay back with interest.

warning

Avoid financial aid scams
-------------------------

You may not need to hire a company to help you find financial aid. Instead, search online for scholarships or ask a school guidance counselor for help.
