Government-backed home loans and mortgage assistance
====================================================

If you want to buy a home, a government-backed home loan or a mortgage assistance program could help. Learn about the types of loans and how to qualify and apply.

info

Important
---------

The federal government does not offer grants or "free money" to individuals to buy a home. Websites and ads claiming to offer "free money from the government" are often scams.

**FHA loans**
-------------

The Federal Housing Administration (FHA) manages the FHA loan program. It helps homebuyers by insuring their loans so lenders can offer lower down payments and closing costs.

FHA loans offer assistance to first-time homebuyers, seniors who partially or fully own their home, and those buying a manufactured or mobile home.

[Find out how FHA loans can help you.](https://www.hud.gov/buying/loans)

### FHA loan eligibility

To qualify for an FHA loan:

* You must have a credit score. FHA loans have a lower credit score requirement than most home loans.
* Find a home that falls within
  [FHA loan limits](https://entp.hud.gov/idapp/html/hicostlook.cfm)
  . These limits depend on the homeâs location.
* Apply for a loan with an FHA-approved lender.
* If you need help, contact the
  [FHA Resource Center](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/housing/sfh/fharesourcectr)
