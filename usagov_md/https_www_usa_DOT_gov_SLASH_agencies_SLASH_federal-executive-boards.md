Federal Executive Boards
(FEBs)
===============================

Federal Executive Boards (FEBs) operate in 28 US cities and provide a forum for collaboration and information exchange between federal field agencies. In this way, field agencies may share best practices and lessons learned, or may coordinate efforts when different agencies adopt programs with similar goals.
