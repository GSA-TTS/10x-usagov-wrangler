What is public housing?
-----------------------

Public housing provides affordable rental homes to people with a low income, seniors, and people with disabilities. Public housing comes in all sizes and types, from single-family houses to high-rise apartments.

Local public housing agencies (PHAs) manage public housing properties. Your local PHA will review your case and determine if you qualify for this benefit. Learn more about public housing on the
[Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) website](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/public_indian_housing/programs/ph)
.

**Find out if you qualify for public housing**
----------------------------------------------

Your eligibility for public housing is determined by your local PHA and is based on:

* Your annual gross income
* If you qualify as a senior, a person with a disability, or a family
* U.S. citizenship or immigration status

[Find your local public housing agency](https://www.hud.gov/program_offices/public_indian_housing/pha/contacts)
to learn if you are eligible.

**How to apply for public housing**
-----------------------------------

The application process for public housing is different in each state. You may need to apply in person. Your local public housing agency will explain the process and tell you what documents to bring to your appointment.
