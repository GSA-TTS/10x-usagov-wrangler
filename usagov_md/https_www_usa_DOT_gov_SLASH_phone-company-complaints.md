Where to file phone company complaints
======================================

Learn where to complain about your home phone or cell phone company.

**Complain to your phone company**
----------------------------------

If you have issues with your phone company's products, services, or billing, begin by contacting the phone company directly.

If calling the phone company does not resolve the problem, you may want to write a complaint letter or email.
[Use this sample complaint letter](https://consumer.ftc.gov/articles/sample-customer-complaint-letter)
as a guide to help you explain the problem to your phone company and what you want them to do to resolve it.

**Complain to the government about your phone company**
-------------------------------------------------------

If you are not satisfied with your phone companyâs response, contact your state government or the Federal Communications Commission (FCC).

* [Contact your state consumer protection office](/state-consumer)
  for help resolving a phone company complaint.
* [Contact the FCC](https://consumercomplaints.fcc.gov/hc/en-us/articles/360001201223)
  to learn about types of phone company problems and to file a complaint using their online form.
