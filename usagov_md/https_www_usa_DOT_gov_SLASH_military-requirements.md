**Education and testing requirements**
--------------------------------------

### ASVAB testing

Everyone who wants to enlist in the military must take the Armed Services Vocational Aptitude Battery (ASVAB). Each branch sets its own minimum score to join. Your score will help decide which jobs you can do after you enlist.

[Use ASVAB online resources](https://www.officialasvab.com/applicants/)
to:

* Find out where to take the test
* Get tips for taking the test
* See sample questions from the 10 sections
* Understand ASVAB scores

Contact a recruiter, who can help you set up a time to take the ASVAB and tell you about the scores you will need.

### Education requirements

You must have a high school or general equivalency diploma (GED) to enlist in the military. There are fewer spots for GED holders to enter the military. If you have a GED, you will have a better chance of joining if you have:

* Earned college credits
* Scored higher on the ASVAB

You must have a degree from a four-year college to

.

**Physical and medical requirements**
-------------------------------------

A medical exam is part of the enlistment process. The exam will assess if you are healthy enough to serve in the military.

Each branch requires recruits to be physically fit. You will have to pass a physical fitness test as part of your enlistment process. Speak with a recruiter to find out the physical requirements for the branch you want to join.
