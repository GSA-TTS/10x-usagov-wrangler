Actions you can take to report fake or unsolicited checks
=========================================================

Someone you don't know sent you a check.

There are many types of fake check scams:

* A check arrives in the mail from a person or company you don't know.
* You sign up for an online job and are sent a check for a "signing bonus."
* An online buyer sends you a fake check that is an overpayment for something youâre selling and asks you to refund them the difference.

**How to report**

Report fake checks you receive by mail to the
[U.S. Postal Inspection Service](https://www.uspis.gov/report)
